				<h2>A Brief History of St. Ignatius Parish</h2>
				<div class="image" style="width:219px"><img src="/pmcasj/images/St.IgnatiusExteriorOld.JPG" alt="alternate text" width="219" height="293"><i><b>St. Ignatius Parish</b><br/>
				6559 North Glenwood Avenue<br/>
				Chicago, Illinois 60626<br/>
				Telephone (773) 764-5936</i></div>
				<p>Until the year 2000, Saint Ignatius was administered by the members of the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits. They had a long and rich history here. 
				A brief sketch of which follows below:</P>
				<p>St. Ignatius Church at Loyola and Glenwood Ave. on the north side of Chicago was founded by the Jesuits from St. Ignatius College on 12th street 
				(now Roosevelt Road) in Holy Family parish. On Mar. 9, 1906, the Jesuits purchased a 20 acre tract of land along Lake Michigan from the Chicago, 
				Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad at a cost of $161.254. In reporting the sale of the lakefront property, The New World noted that: A church will 
				be erected at once on the site, and it is the intention to follow as soon as practicable with the building of a college which may in time attain 
				the dignity of a university.</p>
				<p>Rev. H. J. Dumbach, SJ, rector of St. Ignatius College, celebrated the first Mass in St. Ignatius Church on Feb. 24, 
				1907. The second Mass of the day was celebrated by Rev. Louis Kellingers, SJ, who had been appointed pastor of the new parish. 
				In 1915 , Father David Johnson SJ (appointed pastor in 1910) began to make plans for a permanent church. Ground for the new church and rectory 
				was broken on May 30, 1916. On Aug. 27, Bishop Edmund M. Dunne of Peoria, Ill. laid the cornerstone of St. Ignatius Parish. On the morning 
				of Sept. 16, 1917, Father Johnson, accompanied by members of the parish, carried the Blessed Sacrament from the old frame church on Sheridan Rd. 
				to the new church on St. Ignatius at the northeast corner of Loyola and Glenwood avenues. Archbishop George W. Mundelein officiated at the 
				dedication of the Corinthian style structure later in the day. The new rectory had been completed at 6559 North Glenwood Avenue.</p>
				<p>On August 1st, 2000 the administration of St. Ignatius parish by the Archdiocese of Chicago began. Fr. Jerome Listecki was appointed pastor 
				by Francis Cardinal George, O.M.I. in the Summer with an installment date of Sunday, October 29, at a special 11:00am mass in the parish church. Within the next 
				month, Fr. Listecki was appointed an Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago. Bishop Listecki was allowed to remain as pastor of St. Ignatius until August of 2002.
				In the Summer of 2001, Francis Cardinal George appointed Fr. Joseph Jackson as the new associate pastor of St. Ignatius Parish. Fr. Jackson was ordained 
				in 1974. Fr. Jackson succeeded Bishop Listecki as pastor of St. Ignatius Church in October of 2002 and continues to serve as pastor.</p>
