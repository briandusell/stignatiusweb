					<h3>Fifth Sunday of Lent, April 06, 2014, Year A</h3>
					<p>Ezekiel 37:12-14; Psalm 130:1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8; Romans 8:8-11; John 11:1-45 or 11:3-7,17, 20-27, 33b-45</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today’s first reading is taken from Chapter thirty-seven in Ezekiel which deals with the prophet’s vision of the dry bones. God places flesh on them and they became alive and moved about, but they did not have God’s spirit in them. The Israelite people are like those bones; the are dry and dead from their sins, The Lord God will raise them up, take them out of their graves and enliven them. He will place his spirit in them and lead them back to Israel where he will settle them on their land and they will know that he is their Lord. He has promised and he will do it.</p>
					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
					<p><b>With the Lord there is mercy and fullness of redemption.</b></p>
					<p>Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord;<br/>
					Lord hear my voice!<br/>
					Let your ears be attentive <br/>
					to the voice of my supplication. <b>Response</b></p>
					<p>If you, O Lord, mark iniquities, <br/>
					Lord, who can stand? <br/>
					But with you is forgiveness <br/>
					that you may be revered. <b>Response</b></p>
					<p>I trust in the Lord; <br/>
					my soul trusts in his word. <br/>
					More than sentinels wait for the dawn; 
					let Israel wait for the Lord.<b>Response</b></p>
					<p>For with the Lord is kindness <br/>
					and with him is plentious redemption;<br/>
					And he will redeem Israel<br/>
					from all their iniquities. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>There is no explanation in the New Testament about the origin or day-to-day relationship between Lazarus and his sisters, Martha and Mary, and Jesus; we only know they were very good friends, though even such ‘friendship’ is rarely described.  It is only said that ‘Jesus loved them’ and wept for the suffering of Lazarus and his sisters.   The usual home of Lazarus and his sisters is Bethany, which is situated high up on the west side of the mountain just east of Jerusalem (the mountain is called the Mount of Olives, because of the olive trees there.).  It is from this high area that Jesus will soon descend to enter Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, and it is from this mountain that, in Matthew, Jesus gives his disciples the command, “Go forth and teach all people, baptizing…”  The Lazarus story is basically a cure/miracle story, and as such could be told in few words.  What John has done is expanded this basic story form to teach vital truths about Jesus, ultimately urging ever greater faith in the Jesus who is the source eternal life.  At this time Israelites believed that the soul in some way ‘hovered’ over its corpse for three days, then finally departed; hence, we have the notice, a defense against unbelievers in John’s time, from Martha that her brother died ‘four days ago’ and so makes clear that Lazarus did not return to life in any other way than through the word of Jesus.  Also: Jesus’ remark that Lazarus’s illness would not ‘end in death’ is understood to mean not in ‘eternal death’, thereby suggesting a restoration to life.  [Technically, Lazarus’s return to life is not ‘resurrection’, but rather ‘restoration’; ‘resurrection’ suggests only the rising to eternal life, not to human life.]  A final detail: Martha begins with her understanding of Jesus as healer/miracle-worker and she ends with belief that Jesus is the Messiah and divine Son of God; this type of movement is a subtle urging of the reader to comprehend what his faith has taught him, that the works of Jesus are nothing short of testimony to his divinity.    Another theological faith statement is that the illness of Lazarus will serve the glory of God; this refers to the power Jesus will exhibit as he stuns everyone with an unheard-of restoration to life.  The significance of the miracle is enhanced by the words which express dismay that Jesus did not come to save his friend from death: what kind of love and power should be ascribed to this apparent callousness?  Again, it is a crowd that expresses the human inability to understand the deepest meaning of Jesus and his love, which the story is appositely meant to affirm.  A powerful point, typical of John’s never-ending determination to show the true meaning of Jesus, is Jesus’ reference to himself as ‘the resurrection and the Life’; i.e. he is the giver of life and not just an intermediary who carries life from God to another human being way.  Finally, Martha at first thought Jesus was referring to the final resurrection of the dead, when he said her brother would rise; many Jews, led by the Pharisees, believed that there would be a moment when all the dead would rise for judgment, then for eternal life, whether in the Kingdom of God or in hell; Jesus makes sure that his action and what it means about him and for human beings is not to be confused with the traditional expectation among many Jews that mankind would someday rise from the dead – this restoration will happen NOW.</p>  
					<p>[A note about the proper reading of the text.  Verses 5, 6, and 7 read as follows:</p>
					<p>So when he [Jesus] heard that he [Lazarus] was ill, he remained for two days in the place where he was.<br/>
					Then after this he said to his disciples, “Let us go back to Judea [in Judea is Bethany].”</p>
					<p>One might read the above to say that Jesus remained in Galilee when he, who ‘supposedly’ loved Lazarus, ignored him for two days.  It is better to say that the proper conclusion to Jesus’ hearing that Lazarus was ill was Jesus’ saying to his disciples “Let us go back to Judea”.  With this latter understanding we mean to say two things.  First, the trip from Galilee to Bethany took about five days walking; it was not a simple thing to do.  Second, we know that Jesus was filled with the conviction that he must do the Father’s will, which was preaching the kingdom and calling for repentance.  To immediately interrupt this vital work to cure Lazarus (when he knew he would restore him from the dead) made no sense to Jesus; it seemed more prudent to do essential work, then go to Lazarus to restore him.  Perhaps John would have written better: “So when he heard that he was ill, he said to his disciples, ‘Let us go back to Judea’”.  Such would be the proper reading of the text.</p>

					<p>Rachel wept for her children: "In Ramah is heard the sound of moaning, of bitter weeping! 
					Rachel mourns her children, she refuses to be consoled because her children are no more. 
					Thus says the Lord: Cease your cries of mourning, wipe the tears from your eyes. 
					The sorrow you have shown shall have its reward, says the Lord, 
					they shall return from the enemy's land" (Jeremiah 31:15-17).</p>
