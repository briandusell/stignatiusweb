					<h3>Fourth Sunday of Lent, March 30, 2014, Year A</h3>
					<p>1 Samuel 16:1b, 6-7, 10-13a; Psalm 23:1-3a, 3b-4, 5, 6; Ephesians 5:8-14; John 9:1-41, or 9:1, 6-9, 13-17, 34-38</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today’s readings contain themes of seeing, healing, courage to witness, and to persevere. The first reading emphasizes spiritual seeing and the art of active listening in order to discern. The Gospel contains a healing by an action of Jesus  and washing the one healed carrying overtones of baptism. Samuel is sent to the house of Jesse to select the king from his sons. On seeing the fine sons of Jesse he thought that the Lord’s anointed must be before him. God taught him otherwise, “Not as man sees does God see, because man sees the appearance, but God looks into the heart.” Samuel must wait the Lord’s inner voice telling him of the Lord’s choice. All of Jesse’s sons were not present; the youngest was tending sheep on the mountain (God’s traditional dwelling). Upon David’s entry into the house, the Lord said, “There --anoint him, for this is the one.” With the oil Samuel anointed David in the presence of his brothers and the Holy Spirit rushed upon David. The Gospel reading contains the healing of a man blind from birth and the action to carry out the miracle. The man follows Jesus’ instructions and receives faith to worship Jesus and the courage to witness on his behalf against his enemies.</p>
					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
					<p><b>The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.</b></p>
					<p>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want,<br/>
					In verdant pastures he gives me repose; <br/>
					beside restful waters he leads me;<br/>
					he refreshes my soul. <b>Response</b></p>
					<p>He guides me in right paths for his name’s sake.<br/> 
					Even though I walk in the dark valley I fear no evil; <br/>
					for you are at my side <br/>
					with your rod and your staff that give me courage. <b>Response</b></p>
					<p>You spread the table before me<br/>
					in the sight of my foes;<br/>
					you anoint my head with oil;<br/>
					my cup overflows. <b>Response</b></p>
					<p>Only goodness and kindness follow me<br/>
					all the days of my life; <br/>
					and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord <br/>
					for years to come. <b>Response</b></p>
					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>There are longer and shorter readings of today’s Gospel; since the longer form is 41 verses, I suspect that at most Masses the shorter form will be read, and so it is that about which I will write here.</p>  
					<p>The basic story is one of healing; it is in its simplest form a ‘miracle-story’: the need is presented to Jesus, who heals and then is praised or criticized for his curing.  Most often what is stressed in a miracle-story is the power of Jesus; little is said about the love behind his choice to cure.  Recall that what we have here is a reduction of the original event to a story form, when so often details we would like to have are not preserved, since they are not considered essential to the story’s purpose in telling.  A rarity, seen in this story, is the cure, not by word, but by action.  No doubt the ancient world thought that healing powers belonged to clay (akin to our mud baths); saliva was simply necessary where there was no water easily available.  Some interpreters think that we have here with the use of clay a belief in magic, such as that practiced in healing centers throughout the Mediterranean at this time by ‘magicians’.  But since Jesus almost always cures by word alone, it seems better to think that his use of clay is a symbol of the spiritual blindness with which one lives without faith in Christ.     It seems that also necessary was the washing of the eyes in water – here the Pool of Siloam (located in the southwestern edge of Jerusalem).  Given that symbolism is a major characteristic of John’s Gospel, one concludes that this washing is a symbol of baptism, by which one is cured from sin and given life through the presence of the Holy Spirit.  This role of the Holy Spirit, as giver of life, is greatly emphasized in John’s Gospel, as in the Pauline literature; the Spirit remains the continued divine presence earlier experienced in the person of Jesus Christ.  The miracle story eventually becomes a conflict story: a literary presentation of argumentation about some facet of the miracle.  Here, it is the ‘Jews’ against the cured man; the story now resembles a trial, informal, but still before authority.  [It should be understood that, in this Gospel, ‘Jews’ almost always means the opposition of certain Jewish authorities to Jesus, whether in his public life or in the later life of the community of believers; thus, ‘Jews’ does not mean all Jews.]  The particular argument offered by the Jewish authority of the moment is that the cure worked by Jesus was done on the Sabbath, when one is not allowed to work; healing was considered a work and thus not to be done on the Sabbath.  Jesus then is a sinner to this authority.  Typical of John’s Gospel is the appeal to fact: ‘all I know is that I was blind and now see; who in our history has ever made the blind to see?’  Given that the return of sight is one of the chief promises of Yahweh throughout the OT for his people, and given that such a benefit will characterize the Messiah (whenever he comes and whoever he is), it is not surprising that the newly cured man confesses Jesus to be Messiah – what else could the fact of this cure mean?  The blind man is a symbol of that testimony in which the Gospel places its trust; he was, as Jewish authority claimed, ‘born in sin from birth’ [that is, he was blind from birth and this was a result of sin, Jews thought], and so should not be trusted.  But the fact is the fact, the cure is the cure, and faith follows upon it, as the Gospel insists.  That Jesus presents himself as Son of Man is a claim that he will be the Judge of the world, separating sinners from the obedient.  On the basis of the cure, the man believes that Jesus is this Son of Man; unfortunately, the ‘Jews’ do not; they think they are safe from his final judgment.<p>

					<p>Rachel wept for her children: "In Ramah is heard the sound of moaning, of bitter weeping! 
					Rachel mourns her children, she refuses to be consoled because her children are no more. 
					Thus says the Lord: Cease your cries of mourning, wipe the tears from your eyes. 
					The sorrow you have shown shall have its reward, says the Lord, 
					they shall return from the enemy's land" (Jeremiah 31:15-17).</p>
