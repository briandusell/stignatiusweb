					<h2>Fourth Sunday of Lent<br/>  
					March 30, 2014, Year A</h2>
					<p>1 Samuel 16:1b, 6-7, 10-13a; Psalm 23:1-3a, 3b-4, 5, 6<br/>
					Ephesians 5:8-14; John 9:1-41, or 9:1, 6-9, 13-17, 34-38</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's readings contain themes of seeing, healing, courage to witness, and to persevere. The first reading emphasizes spiritual seeing and the art of active listening in order to discern. The Gospel contains a healing by an action of Jesus  and washing the one healed carrying overtones of baptism. Samuel is sent to the house of Jesse to select the king from his sons. On seeing the fine sons of Jesse he thought that the Lord's anointed must be before him. God taught him otherwise, "Not as man sees does God see, because man sees the appearance, but God looks into the heart." Samuel must wait the Lord's inner voice telling him of the Lord's choice. All of Jesse's sons were not present; the youngest was tending sheep on the mountain (God's traditional dwelling). Upon David's entry into the house, the Lord said, "There --anoint him, for this is the one." With the oil Samuel anointed David in the presence of his brothers and the Holy Spirit rushed upon David. The Gospel reading contains the healing of a man blind from birth and the action to carry out the miracle. The man follows Jesus' instructions and receives faith to worship Jesus and the courage to witness on his behalf against his enemies.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>There are longer and shorter readings of today's Gospel; since the longer form is 41 verses, I suspect that at most Masses the shorter form will be read, and so it is that about which I will write here.</p>  
					<p>The basic story is one of healing; it is in its simplest form a 'miracle-story': the need is presented to Jesus, who heals and then is praised or criticized for his curing.  Most often what is stressed in a miracle-story is the power of Jesus; little is said about the love behind his choice to cure.  Recall that what we have here is a reduction of the original event to a story form, when so often details we would like to have are not preserved, since they are not considered essential to the story's purpose in telling.  A rarity, seen in this story, is the cure, not by word, but by action.  No doubt the ancient world thought that healing powers belonged to clay (akin to our mud baths); saliva was simply necessary where there was no water easily available.  Some interpreters think that we have here with the use of clay a belief in magic, such as that practiced in healing centers throughout the Mediterranean at this time by 'magicians'.  But since Jesus almost always cures by word alone, it seems better to think that his use of clay is a symbol of the spiritual blindness with which one lives without faith in Christ.     It seems that also necessary was the washing of the eyes in water - here the Pool of Siloam (located in the southwestern edge of Jerusalem).  Given that symbolism is a major characteristic of John's Gospel, one concludes that this washing is a symbol of baptism, by which one is cured from sin and given life through the presence of the Holy Spirit.  This role of the Holy Spirit, as giver of life, is greatly emphasized in John's Gospel, as in the Pauline literature; the Spirit remains the continued divine presence earlier experienced in the person of Jesus Christ.  The miracle story eventually becomes a conflict story: a literary presentation of argumentation about some facet of the miracle.  Here, it is the 'Jews' against the cured man; the story now resembles a trial, informal, but still before authority.  [It should be understood that, in this Gospel, 'Jews' almost always means the opposition of certain Jewish authorities to Jesus, whether in his public life or in the later life of the community of believers; thus, 'Jews' does not mean all Jews.]  The particular argument offered by the Jewish authority of the moment is that the cure worked by Jesus was done on the Sabbath, when one is not allowed to work; healing was considered a work and thus not to be done on the Sabbath.  Jesus then is a sinner to this authority.  Typical of John's Gospel is the appeal to fact: 'all I know is that I was blind and now see; who in our history has ever made the blind to see?'  Given that the return of sight is one of the chief promises of Yahweh throughout the OT for his people, and given that such a benefit will characterize the Messiah (whenever he comes and whoever he is), it is not surprising that the newly cured man confesses Jesus to be Messiah - what else could the fact of this cure mean?  The blind man is a symbol of that testimony in which the Gospel places its trust; he was, as Jewish authority claimed, 'born in sin from birth' [that is, he was blind from birth and this was a result of sin, Jews thought], and so should not be trusted.  But the fact is the fact, the cure is the cure, and faith follows upon it, as the Gospel insists.  That Jesus presents himself as Son of Man is a claim that he will be the Judge of the world, separating sinners from the obedient.  On the basis of the cure, the man believes that Jesus is this Son of Man; unfortunately, the 'Jews' do not; they think they are safe from his final judgment.<p>

					<h2>Third Sunday of Lent <br/> 
					March 23, 2014, Year A</h2>
					<p>Exodus 17:1-7; Psalm 95:1-2, 6-7, 8-9<br/>
					Romans 8:1-2, 5-8; John 4:5-42 or 4;5-15, 19b-26, 39a, 40-42</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt and into the desert to freedom. Their bondage in Egypt must be seen here as representing their spiritual bonds. Water is essential and without it we die. The people of the Exodus were to learn just how little faith they had in the Lord their God. At Meribah they tested God and Moses, saying among themselves, "Is the Lord in our midst or not?" They thought and knew that he should be, but they doubted seriously and complained to Moses. Did he intend for them to die in the desert? He in turn 'cried' to the Lord God for help or these people may stone him. The people need to see the signs of God among them, and all must witness it. God must witness to them that they may witness to Him. Moses gathered the elders and all the people around the rock at Meribah, and with his staff, with which he struck the river, strike the rock. Moses did as the Lord commanded and immediately there flowed out clear water for the people to drink. The flowing water that preserves life saved the Israelites who tested God at Meribah. In the Gospel a tired and loving Jesus still desires to give the living water of life to his people.</p>
					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
					<p><b>If today you hear his voice harden not your hearts.</b></p>
					<p>Come, let us sing joyfully to the Lord;<br/> 
					let us acclaim the Rock of our salvation. <br/>
					Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving;<br/>
					let us joyfully sing psalms to him. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<p>Come, let us bow down in worship;<br/>
					let us kneel before the Lord who made us. <br/>
					For he is our God, <br/>
					and we the people he shepherds, the flock he guides. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<p>Oh, that today you would hear his voice:<br/>
					"Harden not your hearts as a Meribah, <br/>
					as in the day of Massah in the desert,<br/>
					Where your fathers tempted me; they tested me though they had seen my works." <b>Response</b></p>
					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>We will comment on the longer (very long) form of this Sunday's Gospel, usually called the story of "The Woman at the Well".  This story occurs as one of the seven signs of John's Gospel, signs which are meant to increase faith in Jesus and so secure eternal life.  A first circumstance offered the reader is that this event occurs in Samara.  Geographically, this means Jesus is somewhere between Galilee, where most all of his public life was spent according to the Synoptics, and Judaea, with its capitol Jerusalem, the place "where all the prophets are put to death".  Also, the story centers on a well, and drawing water.  Finally, besides Jesus, the 'other' character of the story is a woman who has come for water at noon.  These details describe something unusual.  That Jesus is so fully immersed in Samaria is something new to Gospel readers; that he will address a woman when the two of them are alone is not customary at all; that the woman draws water at noon suggests what is made clearer in the later story: because of her marital situation(s) she cannot draw water at the time this is usually done by the women of Sychar.  With the disciples away to get some food, Jesus asks the woman for a drink of water.  The woman lodges an objection which is only answered much later in the story: Jews and Samaritans are mortally enemies, and have been ever since the Samaritans began to exist, for despite Samaritans' claims to be the true children of Jacob, Israel considered them heretics, like pagans.  In theory and in practice Samaritans are to be shunned.  Apparently ignoring the woman's protest, Jesus, in the next few verses speaks about a water he could give her if only she asked it of him.  (It is necessary here to be clear about 'water'; well water was brackish, the left-over from the Mediterranean rains.  Good was the water that was fresh.  Everyone wanted flowing or 'living' water; by necessity people had to settle for well water.)  The water Jesus promises is the Holy Spirit, the giver of life; this the evangelist will make clear only in a later chapter.  The woman tries to grasp the identity of Jesus: is he greater than the forefather who provided this well?  Again, Jesus ignores the Christological question of his identity, promising the wonders of the 'water' he can give to one who believes in him.  This part of the story which talks symbolically of the Spirit ends with the woman not really understanding the words of Jesus, but to the believer is assured that presence of the Spirit ('a spring of water) who brings one to eternal life.  John now changes theme: he will note the distinction between pre-Jesus worshipers and Jesus' followers.  The first group had their own places of worship, a mountain of Samaria and the mountain topped by Jerusalem.  From a Jewish point of view, represented by Jesus, the Samaritans worship what 'they do not know' and Jews worship Yahweh of the Old Testament.  But the day has arrived when Christians will worship God in Spirit and truth.  "Spirit" here refers to the presence of the Spirit, the 'spring of water', who will guide Christian worship, a worship which is true, for it is the believer in Christ who has the truth about God.  Such words from Jesus draw the statement, 'these are words of the Messiah, not simply of a prophet.  For the first time, Jesus testifies here that indeed he is the Messiah.  Again, the scene changes to a new focus.  While the woman still ponders whether Jesus be the Messiah (something John's readers already know and believe), Jesus is pictured as looking over ripe Samaritan fields, ready for a harvest.  He now describes himself as one who wants to do his Father's will; he calls this 'wanting' his real food.  He foresees the harvesting which has culminated, by Gospel time, in the faith of many in himself; indeed, John will insist that very many have come to faith in Jesus, so that the Johannine community can understand not only its own role in preaching Jesus, but the fact that it is the result of the preachings of many early Christians.  You might have guessed that John, while narrating an event of the30's AD, is really looking at the whole story from the point of view of Christians in 90'sAD.  Jesus seems to be talking not only to people of his own time, but to the Johannine community now reading Jesus' story.  Finally, John reports the fact that, once the Samaritan citizens met Jesus, who stayed with them for three days (not said by the Synoptics), they no longer needed to hear the testimony of the woman about Jesus; meeting him directly moved them believe in him.  They call him 'Savior of the world'.  As happens in most stories within Chapters  2-12, John makes sure that the Christological titles used in the 90's AD appear in the Gospel.  While it is doubtful that people of Jesus' time understood fully these titles, by 90AD they did, and so John inserts them in their full sense into a story where people grasp the meaning of Jesus only in a limited sense.  We should note that we hear nothing again about the Samaritan woman, and that we meet up with a Christian mission to Samaria only in Chapters 8 and 9 of Acts.  John is more than willing to slide that later mission into his Gospel time, for the Gospel time was to bear the fruit of this later Samaritan mission.</p>

					<h2>The Second Sunday of Lent<br/>
					March 16, 2014, Year A</h2>
					<p>Genesis .12:1-4; Psalm 33: 4-5, 18-19, 20, 22 <br/>
					2 Timothy 1:8b-10; Matthew 17:1-9</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>It is not unusual for God to give one a great need accompanied by the desire to fulfill his need. Abraham's was just such a case. He and his wife were childless and had a great desire to be parents. God would help and asked Abraham to leave his father's house and the land of his kinsfolk for a land the Lord will show him. Abraham obeyed without question at that time. The Lord would make a great nation of him and bless him among the communities of the earth. The test to challenge  Abraham's faith came when God asked him to sacrifice his only son Isaac, thus eliminating any future natural progeny. Abraham was equal to the task and became a man transformed, our father in faith.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>This Gospel narrates the Transfiguration of Jesus on an unspecified mountain top (a favorite place of revelation for Judaism and other religions).  That Peter was chosen to witness this transfiguration is one more sign of his importance in the Christian communities, especially after they grew once Jesus was gone.  Why James and John are present is not so clear, though John is the beloved disciple (if one accepts that identification.  The importance of John and James is made clear from the Acts of the Apostles; they are leaders of the Jerusalem Christian community, the foundation community, and are most important witnesses in that book of the truths about Jesus.  Thus, they, like Peter, grew in importance from the earliest Christian times.  The two concrete qualities that manifested the transfiguration are a 'face that shone like the sun' and 'clothes white as light'.  The transfiguration itself is not explained.  The Jewish psyche would immediately recognize the appeals to sun and light as characteristics of the Divine.  In a Gospel which has witnessed to the divinity of Jesus as born, it is most significant that now the person of Jesus is once again affirmed to be divine.  Further, the affirmation of Jesus' divinity at birth is intended to be a guide to interpreting the entire life of Jesus to be described in the Gospel.  Similarly, there is purpose in revealing him so dramatically as divine here, and that purpose is to leave with the disciples the memory of the real identity of Jesus as he is very soon is about to undergo his Passion.  One must never forget in the horrific treatment of Jesus that he is God.  It is understood that Moses and Elijah are to be interpreted as the pillars of prophecy, Moses for the Law and Elijah for the Prophets.  It is Luke who makes clear the point that these two august figures are discussing with Jesus his coming Passion; it is in the Law and Prophets that one will find the plan that the Messiah abandon for the moment his power and innocence and wisdom so as to undergo the cross.  It is understandable that the disciples want to stay with Jesus as he is revealed to be their God; also understandable is the note that it is Peter speaks the mind of the disciples - Peter who is very outspoken and who is, and will be, the chief spokesman of the earliest witnesses to Jesus.   Their desire to have Jesus stay represents the desire of the Christian communities of Matthew's experience to have Jesus with them always.  'Tents' is a symbol reference to what the OT knows to be 'the good old times' of simple life in the desert with Yahweh.  All is interrupted by God's words from the symbol of cloud.  These are the same words as heard at Jesus' baptism.  There they spoke of a son who was most pleasing because of his devotion to execute the divine plan; here they are directed to his particular obedience to the will of God that he die.  Added to the saying of God are the words, "Listen to him", which is a call to take seriously Jesus' various predictions of his Passion.  As was true throughout the ancient world, to hear the words of God will strike fear in the heart: one is never sure why God intervenes in human life, and that uncertainty makes the human being fearful.  The cloud, symbol in the OT of the presence and movement of God, leaves.  It falls to Jesus to strongly urge his disciples to say nothing of the experience they have witnessed till after his resurrection.  This is a subtle way of saying that only when all the experiences of Jesus's life were put together and meditated upon, did the disciples truly begin to understand all about Jesus.  Before the resurrection they never understood the deepest reality of Jesus, particularly could they make no sense of the suffering of one who was for many months so powerful, wise and close to God. </p>

					<h2>The First Sunday of Lent<br/>
					March 09, 2014, Year A</h2>
					<p>Genesis 2:7-9; 3:1-7; Psalm 51:3-4, 5-6, 12-13, 17 <br/>
					Romans 5:12-19 or 5:12, 17-19; Matthew 4:1-11,</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's readings present to us Adam and Eve in the Garden with the Serpent and Jesus in the desert with Satan. In the first reading the man and woman fail mankind; in the Gospel Jesus redeems the human race. The Lord God formed man from clay and blew into his nostrils the breath of life. Man became a living human being; at death we will return God's gift to him.   God planted a garden with trees delightful to look at and good for food. The man and woman could eat of the trees in the garden except from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To partake of its fruit was to disobey God, gain knowledge, and to die. The first and second took place immediately; disobedience alienated them from God and they now knew that they were naked. Their wisdom, shame and fear, knowing good and evil. They were dead to God (spiritual death) and would eventually die a natural death --the effects of sin. How  can man redeem himself? He cannot; the creature is of the earth, he is not divine. Having rejected the gift of God's life, man, of himself,  cannot become what he is not. Only God can save mankind; only God can forgive, but to forgive is not to redeem! Today's Gospel reflection gives us some idea of the work and meaning of redemption by Jesus Christ. </p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Jesus' three temptations in the desert, according to Luke. Exegetes look at this episode from two angles: the meaning of the story in itself, then the meaning of the story in the full Gospel.  We look at the story from these two perspectives.  Jesus goes into the desert (presumably that territory east of the Jordan River where he was baptized).  The best suggestion is that Jesus went there to reflect on the experience he had, the coming of the Spirit upon him and the voice from Heaven, "You are my beloved Son, my beloved."  Jesus, we think, understood this experience to be his calling to be the person described in Isaiah's four songs about "the Servant of God".  This servant, Isaiah says, is to preach repentance at first to Israel, then to the nations; thereafter, he, though innocent, will suffer death so that the guilty, who should die for their sins, may go free, forgiven.  With this background we read the temptations of Satan against the completion of these tasks of God's servant, also called 'My beloved Son'.  (Here, that God calls Jesus "My son, the beloved", stresses Jesus' filial obedience, though, as Luke has already argued in the Annunciation, Jesus will be born of the Spirit and Power from on High, and so will be called divine Son of God.  Obedience, not divinity, is stressed now.  The three responses to Satan's temptations are the teaching of this episode.  They are offered to a Satan who does not wonder who Jesus is, but what might move him to back away from the role of Servant.  First, to Satan's suggestion that Jesus will find food by his power, Jesus says that to attain true life, unending life, one must and will obey the word of God.  No human power/wealth, but only obedience to the will of God will merit eternal life.  To Satan's offer of an entire kingdom if Jesus will adore him, Jesus responds with the OT core statement: Only God (Yahweh) do I adore.  One may esteem people greatly, but only one deserves adoration, the Creator of the creature; no one takes God's place, and the creature, as creature, must adore; such is the nature of being a creature.  Finally, to Satan's suggestion that Jesus test God's love for him by putting himself in mortal danger, Jesus affirms that he will not tempt God, because he has no need to prove God's love for him.  This is a statement of total trust in God's unfailing love, no matter what the circumstances (e.g. crucifixion) may be in Jesus' future.  This Lucan narrative serves the entire Gospel in that it reveals, before Jesus' public life begins, what are the essential principles that guide his every choice: obedience to what God wants, adoration of God alone, absolute confidence in God's love for him always.  Luke means to say, then, that, in a world not accustomed to psychology as ours is, the reader must always carry with him this understanding of the workings of Jesus' mind and will.  Jesus will aver to one or other of these principles in his public life, particularly when he notes that he has been sent to announce the presence of the Kingdom of God and that he has come to call sinners.  Most important is the revelation of his mind in the Garden, when, faced with ugly death, he asks his Father to save him, but that he will drink this bitter cup if this is his Father's will.  And he will obey and worship in absolute trust that God's love is even in this crucifixion.</p>

				    <h2>The Eighth Sunday in Ordinary Time<br/>
					March 02, 2014, Year A</h2>
					<p>Isaiah 49:14-15, 17-18; Psalm 62:2-3, 6-7, 8-9<br/> 
					1 Corinthians 4:1-5; Matthew 6:24-34</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's reading deal with the relationship between God and mankind, and how mankind is weak on his responsibilities and his understanding of God. "Zion said, 'The Lord has forsaken me; my Lord has forgotten me.'" Really? Out of consideration this "forgetful" Lord maintains his response within the created world and asks: "Can a woman forget her infant; be without tenderness for the child of her womb?" Think about it, such is her love. Even if she were to forget, "I will never forget you." God will not, cannot forget his child. We belong to him, we are part of him and his person as a human being in Jesus Christ. As we see in today's Gospel, He loves his creation and cares for it.</p>
					<p>In the light of this truth about the source of happiness and the obedience or service to achieve it, Jesus will speak of God as only source of the happiness for which we long. Jesus' preference for Yahweh over Riches comes here not from argument, but from his undeniable wisdom: he urges the disciple to "seek first the kingdom of God and all these things will be given you besides (that kingdom)."</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Life is about more than food and the body about more than clothing. Jesus concluded there is more to life than food. What kind of life and what kind of food had he in mind? He refers them to his creatures --they obey God's commands. Look at the birds; they don't sow or reap, but your heavenly Father feeds them, and you are worth so much more to him. The flowers are dressed as beautifully as Solomon in all his glory, yet, at the end of the day they are burned in the furnace. How much more will he care for you, "You of little faith?"</p>
					<p>Isaiah dealing with the feelings of abandonment by Zion, and Jesus dealing with the lack of trust in his disciples, address the same issue -- lack of faith. By becoming aware of our lack of trust and knowledge of God, we are meant to understand Jesus who is God's Beloved Son and a human man. Jesus, himself, had to grow in awareness of God's love for humanity and his creation. Obviously, as part of the  Father's plan, Jesus knew that God loves his creatures, but he had to see and experience as a human, God's love for humanity. This love of God for man, realized by man, is motivation for man to choose to serve God and not Mammon. The birds must search for their food; man must obey God's commands. The animals obey God instinctively; man obeys freely, and with God's grace willingly. The birds forage for their food in their environment; mankind is given his food through receiving the sacraments of the Church --the environment of God in the world.

					<p>In the Book of Leviticus the Lord God instructs Moses to tell the community of Israel to be holy, for the Lord God is holy. 
					The holy person loves as God loves -- He loves all. Such love includes our neighbor and our enemies. We cannot love only some; the pagans do that, so it is not perfect. If God is perfect, and he is holy, then we ought to be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect. The person who is holy comes closest to loving as our heavenly Father loves.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>In this Gospel reading we are given the final two antitheses of the Sermon on the Mount; these antitheses, each in its own way, differ significantly from the teaching of the authoritative teachers of Jesus' time.  Thus, it is a matter of who understands God's will best, whose wisdom best guides human life.   The first antithesis we hear presents the biblical OT teaching, 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth'; the second, 'you shall love your neighbor.'  For a better explanation of the first 'eye for an eye', I should start with the second 'you shall love'.  The command to love neighbor is never joined in the OT with the command to hate one's enemy; that fuller statement is a human effort to make sure the Israelite has nothing to do with an enemy (especially with one who does not respect the Mosaic Law) and thus to limit one's obligation to love one's enemy.  Thus, it is lawful to hate a Samaritan, who is known to deny much of God's action in Israel's favor; Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan flies in the face of this interpretation of God's will about love of neighbor.  Jesus' teaching about God's will insists on love of both neighbor and enemy.  The explanation for this teaching is God's own love of His enemies: He provides life for them instead of death, for He provides the essentials which keep them alive, which are sun and water.  Being a child of a parent means that one will imitate that parent; one looks to God's actions towards His enemies to learn what, of one wants to be a child of God, must imitate.  To help only one's friends is to do what sinners do, those who have no respect for God; one cannot live only with this kind of love.  The question of importance here is: Who is my neighbor?  Paul asked it of his readers, and the authoritative teachers asked it of Jesus (and of each other).  Is one obliged to love a pagan; if not, then a sinful Jew?  Is it not better to say one's obligation to love extends only to the virtuous, for whom one should be willing to suffer?  Jesus says love extends to all, for the Israelite loves as God loves - which means 'all'.  To love only a portion of God's human creatures is to be imperfect; to be perfect, like God, one loves all.  To be 'perfect', 'complete' is the meaning of shalom; thus, be 'shalom', be perfect and complete, like God.  With this understanding of the final antithesis one interprets the previous antithesis (and indeed all antitheses).  Jesus differs from other teachers in his application of the essential command 'love God and love neighbor'.  Jewish teachers agreed with Jesus about the centrality of this divine command.  The antithesis we look at now offers four examples (resistance, cloak as well as tunic, the 'extra mile', giving to the borrower) to consider.  None of these examples are to be raised to the level of universal principle; they are only examples, though of a deeper and universal principle of morality.  (Thus, the non-resistance movement, though founded in part on the words of this antithesis, is not correct if in all circumstances, non-resistance is 'the moral right thing to do'; e.g. one cannot practice, as the will of Jesus, the law of non-resistance if one, while President of a nation, refuses to resist the attacking enemy - such a resistance denies the law of love neighbor and so cannot be considered to be the teaching of Jesus.  Non-resistance is recommended only to the degree that it fosters love of neighbor.)  Again, should one seek payment of a debt by taking property (i.e. a tunic - the undergarment), the debtor should also offer his outer garment (i.e. a cloak).  This action manifests a justice from the debtor, who owes much to the kindness of the lender.  Again, circumstances will dictate when and how such a kindness to a lender fulfills the only law that really matters: love of neighbor.  Another example of this antithesis is 'going another mile'.  It was the law in Israel that one was obliged to carry a soldier's burden (a Roman soldier was an enemy to these Israelites) one mile, provided he be carrying out a military order and the burden was job-related; no doubt, this law was greatly abused.  An example of this law was the forcing Simon from Cyrene, Africa, to carry Jesus' cross to Calvary.  Hateful as it was to be made to carry the enemy's kit, Jesus urges one to offer to go an extra mile - provided that, as always, one is thereby offering love to an enemy.  Finally, there is the example of one wanting or needing to borrow (not of formal begging).  There are reasons for not lending, of course, but Jesus wants the potential lender to be motivated by love of the borrower, not by self-interest alone.      The antitheses are an excellent, though limited, peek at how the Israelites lived and what they were taught virtue to be.  No one denied the importance of the Mosaic Law, but, by Jesus' time, there were significant differences in its interpretation among teachers - and if the differences were crucial enough, one might die to witness the truth of his teaching.  Indeed, so valuable was the teaching of Jesus that Matthew, fifty years after Jesus' life in Israel, thought that his own readership should hear and read it.</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's readings deal with freedom and responsibility. In the first reading illustrates how God expresses his wisdom through his gifts to humankind. Our freedom to choose and keep God's commands saves us; to live in God is the result of our freely trusting him. We can take in our hands fire or water to possess one or the other. We are offered life and death, good and evil, whichever we choose will be given us. In his infinite wisdom God allows us to choose our eternal end!
					We glimpse the depth of God's wisdom and he sees all our actions; his eyes are on those who fear him, for he trusts they will keep his word. He commands no one to act unjustly; he is only good, and no one has license to sin. We are completely free to love God for he favors us, but we must overcome the flesh and our selfish love of self.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Like last Sunday, we are in the famous Sermon on the Mount (somewhere in Galilee).  The 'Mount' is an important symbol in Jewish history; the greatest example of the mount is that famous Mount Sinai - on it Moses received the Covenant Law which unites God (wisdom shared) and Israel (obedience).  Jesus on the Mount presents the will of God anew, i.e. with the perfect interpretation of that will.  Unfortunately, Jesus had to take issue with contemporary interpretations (particularly those of Pharisees, Scribes and Sadducees); he did not disagree with all that Pharisees/Sadducees/Scribes taught, but his disagreements with them were sufficient to have them want him dead.  They thought he was misleading the people in fundamental ways, and that merited him death.  Thus, Matthew presents first a Jesus who makes clear that he is not out to change the Law or to suppress it; after all, it is the wisdom of God and not to be abused.  Rather, should it seem that Jesus is changing the Law (i.e. giving meaning that authoritative Jewish teachers taught) or abandoning it, one should realize that what Jesus is doing is showing the truest, i.e. most perfect understanding of God's will - and let the teachings of others fall by the way.  Indeed, it is understood that the final judgment will focus on one's keeping the Law or not; in the light of this fact, it is foolish to misunderstand and thus not obey the Law or will of God.   Needless to say, Matthew, writing fifty years after the condemnation of Jesus, means to correct the judgment against him by claiming that he, not other teachers, are the ones who ruined the Law of God for the people.</p>     
					<p>The second half of our Gospel reading considers what have come to be called the 'antitheses'; i.e. they are statements of Jesus which are in one way or another antithetical to contemporary teaching.  Our Gospel reading presents four of these antitheses: the subjects of killing, adultery, divorce and swearing oaths.  First, Jesus does not counter present teaching on killing with a teaching of 'no killing'; rather what he takes issue with is the teaching that abuse of neighbor, as long as it is not killing, will not merit condemnation.  His examples of abuse are ugly and merit the condemnation of the existing magistrates of Israel.  Jesus urges forgiveness of neighbor, not killing, noting that it can happen that it will be too late to avoid punishment.  It should be noted that, once one is jailed, the usual way out is that one earn daily, by work in prison, enough money to pay his way out.  His assets are frozen so his family cannot pay his debt.  Second, adultery, a clear violation of the Law, involves not just physical intercourse with someone freely belonging to another, but one can equal physical acts with desires.  Jesus does not distinguish a temptation to lust from a choice of desire; such distinction is left to others to describe.  There follows a teaching about divorce.  Jesus claims that divorce, as an act of 'un-love of neighbor', is wrong.  If one says that Moses allowed for divorce, Jesus corrects him by nothing why Moses allowed this, and appeals to the unbreakable unity intended in the earliest chapters of Genesis.  Now, it is important to realize that, while Jesus forbade divorce for his contemporaries, both Paul and Matthew allowed for divorce for very limited reasons in their own times.  The principle allowing for this change of Jesus' teaching is that Jesus did not face the problems that societies in Paul's (50AD) and Matthew's (85AD) had to face.  The assumption is that Jesus would have agreed with these two disciples, if he had had to deal with their problems.[When all is said and done, scholars are not sure what Matthew means by his phrase, 'except in the case of porneia'; 'porneia' had many sexually impermissible meanings, all of which, if a partner were guilty of them, would allow the other partner to divorcé.  Today, the most popular understanding of 'porneia' is to marry within family relationships, such as brother marrying sister.  These relationships, which forbid marriage, are found in Leviticus 18.]  Finally, with oath-swearing, Jesus finds fault with such a practice essentially because it means that one calls on God for the authority to assure the future.  Jesus would rather one leave God out of one's predictions or statements: just say 'yes' or 'no'. Soon we shall see the principle which underlies these and other antitheses, indeed, the entire teaching of Jesus.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>This Gospel reading is part of a 3-chapter account of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.  Matthew is unique and famous for 5 major addresses of Jesus, which are so placed in the Gospel as to seem to intentionally divide the Gospel into more or less equal parts.  The Sermon on the Mount, the first of these 5 discourses, offers a substantial presentation of Jesus' moral teaching, i.e. his wisdom; his wisdom, the Gospel shows, is the most accurate understanding of the mind of God known to human beings in the moral sphere.  After Jesus' famous beatitudes, the Lord turns to two metaphors by which to describe those who believe in him (which means they accept his moral understanding of God's commands).  These two metaphors are salt and light; by means of them, Jesus means to describe his church.    Salt is a commodity quite precious in Jesus' Israel; human beings know it gives life and taste.  Occasionally, a new-born child was wrapped in a salt laden cloth to preserve its life in its new environment outside the womb.  Without salt, one knows food that can be relatively tasteless.  Thus, Jesus means to indicate that his followers are to give life and taste to the human condition; without such "salt" human existence is subject to something like death and has no taste.  These latter elements characterize the world that refuses Jesus.  It belongs the his followers to change the tasteless, lifeless world that knows him not.  [There were no salt-shakers for ordinary people in Galilee; they had rocks of salt, shavings from which would give zest to their food.  When this rock of salt is left on the shelf for a lengthy period, it can lose its saltiness.  What Galileans would do with these rocks was to place them on paths used for walking.  In the extended rainy season, when these dirt paths would be muddy, rocks of salt offered stepping-stones to keep one from slippery mud.]  If a Christian, Jesus teaches, loses his 'saltiness', he offers the world neither life nor zest; such is the world's dependence on Jesus' wisdom and those who practice this wisdom.  While this metaphor-based teaching is positive, the complete words of Jesus turn toward the negative: he speaks about one 'who loses his saltiness'.  This negative aspect contrasts with the second, more positive metaphor-based teaching, that about 'light'.  This difference between 'negative' and 'positive' suggests to scholars that these two sayings were given at first independent of each other, and that it was either Matthew or his source which bound them together as we find them in the Gospel.  This serves as one example among many which argue that the teachings of Jesus, now in one unified form, were originally given separately and on varied occasions; they were later joined together into one discourse which focuses all these disparate sayings on one major theme.  One cannot say enough about the significance of light for the earliest readers of the Gospel.  Note that the first thing God creates in Genesis is light.  Light stands for life, wisdom, truth, love ("you are the light of my life") and joy, and is the opposite to hateful death, foolishness, falsehood, hatred and discouragement.  The OT says that Israel is to be the light of the world, and Jesus says that he is the light of the world.  Now the followers of Jesus are that light, which is spelled out as their deeds.  Their deeds can overcome moral death, foolishness, deceit and hate.  Thus, with a few lines Jesus reveals the glory of his followers: salt to a world tending ever toward lifelessness and tastelessness (meaninglessness) and light to a world for its life and love and wisdom, to know how to live and whom to love.</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>The prophet Malachi tells us that the Lord is sending his messenger to prepare the way before him. It recalls the coming of the Lord Jesus to Bethlehem described by the prophet Isaiah, but in Malachi the Lord is coming to the Temple in Jerusalem. Saint John tells us that a man named John (the Baptist) was sent by God to prepare the way of the Lord. When the adult Jesus revealed himself as the One, John told the inquiring crowds that he must decrease and Jesus must increase. With the arrival of Jesus in public ministry, the work of his precursor was finished. In Luke's Gospel, Simeon is the one to predict the sufferings in the future of Jesus and Mary. At the sight of the child Jesus Simeon recognized that the promise of God to him had been fulfilled:</p>
					<p>"Now, Master, you may let your servant go in peace, according to your word, for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you prepared in the sight of all peoples; a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory for your people Israel."

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>We are given a long Gospel reading, or a shorter version of it.  I will comment on the longer version which includes the material of the shorter version.  The Gospel presents the story of the Presentation of Jesus, and the Purification of Mary.  Luke treats Mary's purification briefly.  She, like all new mothers, was obliged to be purified, i.e. declared 'clean' by an official (a priest in the Jerusalem Temple).  Her impurity was that in childbirth she had emitted blood and other liquids, all of which, as was the understanding of medicine at the time, could make a person ill or dead.  Such a spilling of inner liquids must keep a person from association with other Israelite groups, especially from the women gathered in the women's section of the Jerusalem Temple for communal worship of Yahweh.   Purification, however, was only one obligation imposed by Mosaic Law; a second was that a new-born male was to be offered to God 40 days after his birth (females 80 days).  This is not circumcision, the symbol of belonging to the Chosen People; this offering means to remind Israel that God had let the Angel of Death kill every first-born Egyptian male (animal as well as human) in order to free Israel from Egypt.  The first-born of Israel were saved from this slaughter by putting the blood of a lamb on their doorposts and lintels, thus signaling to the Angel that the first-born of this household should live by God's mercy.  Jesus, a first-born (called that though Mary had no other children), had to be offered in recognition of this wonderful saving event; animals had to be sacrificed in the Jerusalem Temple area, but humans could not be put to death, so an animal (pigeons or turtledoves for the poor) would be sacrificed in the place of the son.  In a broader view, the first-fruit of a harvest was always offered to God in recognition of the fact that all birth/growth ultimately is owed to God, and, technically, is His.   When going about this ritual, Mary and Joseph encounter Simeon; note what he says is inspired, therefore not to be doubted, as the authority for what he says is nothing other than God.  He identifies Jesus as both the light for the Gentiles (who, for Jews, were always 'in the dark' because they knew neither the true God nor, consequently, true human moral conduct) and the glory of Israel (whose glory then is based on Jesus the Jew, particularly because of his death and resurrection - thus, Jesus is the basis for glorifying Israel). Simeon's opening words suggest to many that he represents the OT order, which now is to pass into the greatest of God's benefits - salvation by God-made-man; Israel had longed for this coming and now can be dismissed in favor of Jesus.  Added to Simeon's interpretation of Jesus is his prophecy that Jesus will be a subject of controversy, suggesting that he will die because of disputes about him; his Mother is to suffer as well because of this death.  That Joseph and Mary were amazed at Simeon's words seems impossible given all that had been revealed to them in the previous stories about their child, but the truth is that no revelation intended to make thoroughly understandable what would happen in future events.  Thus, though Mary knew that Jesus was Son of God did not mean she could easily anticipate all that would happen to Jesus and to herself.  Knowledgeable as she was at any one moment, there were always new, unexpected things to learn - she was known principally, not for her intelligence, but for her trust in whatever would come to her from God.  The appearance of Anna, called a prophetess and a faithful Israelite (both meant to fill Luke's reader with continued faith), speaks well of Jesus; her presence, in the Court of the Women (Men had their own Court for prayer), is seen by many exegetes as Luke's attempt to balance prophecy by a man (Simeon) with that of the woman (Anna).  Luke concludes with a brief summary.  An important note is that the 'wisdom' of Jesus is best understood as 'learned wisdom'; i.e. Jesus the adult was very well-versed in the OT, and learned his wisdom from his childhood.  His wisdom is not 'infused' wisdom, nor from his divinity; it was hard-earned by study.  That he was pleasing to God reflects his piety as a young person and as a teenage and young adult.  That he did what he did reflects the truth that, though divine, he was like us in all things (e.g. study and piety), except sin.  As a final note: Simeon's reference to the Gentiles ("he will be a light to the Gentiles") is the one clear reference to speak about the day when the divine word will be spoken to others than Israel; scholars understand it to be a preparation for Luke's second volume, the Acts of the Apostles, a book dedicated to the preaching not done by Jesus who spoke, as Luke has it, only to the Jews.</p>

					<p>The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali described as the District of the Gentiles, also had many Jews living there at that time.

Was the anguish in flight that of Jews living among Gentiles of lax moral standards? Was the darkness dispelled that of Gentiles feeling lost because they had no God? Their reason for joy: the Light of God now shone on both in that land of recent gloom, for Jesus had made Galilee the center from which to preach his word. The people had reason to be joyful as at harvest time to celebrate the fruit of the land and the goodness of God. We see that goodness in today's Gospel. Jesus takes up the mission of John the Baptist who has been imprisoned.  John's mission is just about completed; he has made straight the way of the Lord, who has arrived and is the fruit of John's work. In Jesus John's mission continues and will continue in the world until Jesus returns to reap his harvest.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Zebulun and Naphtali, 2 of the 12 sons of Jacob, were the founders of tribes that carried their names for centuries.  These tribes were established in what was later (and now is) Galilee.  The tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali do not take up all the territory of Galilee in Jesus' time, but they do include such places associated with Jesus such as Nazareth, Cana and Capernaum; Zebulun's eastern border is the Sea of Galilee.  Through this land of Zebulun and Naphtali caravans of precious cargo passed from Egypt all the way to India and from India to Egypt; much of Zebulun and Naphtali was flat land that favored walking traders and their animals. Centuries before the time of Jesus. God, through Isaiah, promised that a great light would appear in land of these two ancient Israelite Patriarchs, i.e. in what would be called Galilee.  It is Matthew who, as so very often, finds the appropriate words of God in the Jewish Scriptures to fit the 'Jesus situation' and who, believing in Jesus, affirms that this Scripture, when fully understood, applied to Jesus.</p>
					<p>Light is one of those primordial images used to counter the human experience of ignorance, doubt and confusion, losing one's way in life, and death.  Thus, when Matthew moves to present Jesus (fresh from his baptism and 40 days in the desert), it seemed most fitting to prepare the reader to understand Jesus: he is the light meant to bring wisdom and life - nothing short of that.  I cannot stress enough the fact that Matthew did not present Jesus in his marvelous activities without a guide, a divine guide (for such is Scripture to these people) by which to interpret Jesus properly.  He is light, and overcomes death and all the little deaths that occur before the final end to life.  It should be said that 'life' is not the same as 'immortality'; in this world there is, for many, no doubt that a human being will continue immortal, after death; the question is will he enjoy life, which includes his own perfection, peace, joy and happiness.  It is to secure the latter that Jesus appears, trying to help people prepare by repentance for the undoubted final judgment, that will decide, not immortality or not, but life or not.  To this initial presentation of Jesus' appearance in Galilee and a summary of his message and his actions, Matthew 'begins at the beginning' by telling of the call of disciples to follow Jesus.  It was quite common that good, wise teachers in Israel would draw students, but it was quite irregular that students would actually give up their livelihoods and families to wander from place to place with this teacher - and it is practically unheard of that women would be among these wandering disciples and teacher.  Matthew's brief descriptions are, no doubt, missing many of the details that these deliberate calls enjoyed; traditional handing down of these stories causes such loss, for storytellers honed their stories so that only details were kept that would help them achieve the reasons for telling their stories.</p>
					<p>In this case, what Matthew wants to stress is the immediacy of four men to leave all at the word of the Lord.  Perhaps it seems psychologically unlikely that people would leave all to follow someone who has not, at least as the story develops, been introduced to the one calling them.  But, as the Infancy Stories have already made clear, this is not 'some stranger', but the Lord, God with us, Messiah and Savior.  Logically, then, the only proper response to a call to total following from this Person is to follow totally.  Is Matthew's concern here to explain the devotedness of the four followers, known in Christian history, as the trusted witnesses to Jesus and the foundation of the Church?  Yes, but even more is Matthew concerned that his story truly be an exhortation that his audience of 80-85AD, in whatever God asks of them, imitate the total obedience of the disciples, for Jesus is Lord.</p>

					January 19, 2014, Year A</h2>
					<p>Isaiah 49:3, 5-6; Psalm 40:2, 4, 7-8, 8-9, 10<br/>
					1 Corinthians 1:1-3; John 1:29-34</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's first reading is the second suffering servant passage from the prophet Isaiah. Israel is a personification of the servant. Gradually the suffering servant was thought by scholars to be one particular person.   God shows his glory through this person, so Isaiah tells us. The Lord has spoken who has formed him from the womb since the beginning of the world. By following God's words this servant takes upon himself God's strength. God in his goodness will not keep him as a slave but will make him a light to the nations of the world. His mission will be one of suffering and surrender. Today Jesus is believed to be the suffering servant prophesied by Isaiah. His identification and the carrying out of his mission is described below in today's Gospel and reflection.</p>

					I did not restrain my lips, as you, O Lord know. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Our Gospel asks us to consider the baptism of Jesus from the viewpoint of the Evangelist John.  This Gospel passage means, in a minor key, to separate Jesus from John, and, in a major key, to begin the testimonies that run throughout the Fourth Gospel: Jesus is the divine Son of God.  This Gospel is content to offer fewer stories about the life of Jesus, but thinks that what it does offer is sufficient to aid its audience to 'believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and that in believing you may have life'.  There is little morality offered in John's Gospel (the most is the rather general statement of Jesus that 'you should love one another as I have loved you' (which is more demanding than what is in the OT: you should love one another as you want to be loved).  Indeed, so much is Christology emphasized to the exclusion of morality that many think that John's First Letter is a correction of this imbalance.       John separates himself from Jesus in what is the traditional Christian understanding of the first century: he is greater, I am less.  The sign of this distinction is the difference in baptisms offered by Jesus and John.  John's baptism is a public sign of repentance and a plea for forgiveness; Jesus' baptism is an immersion into the very Life (Holy Spirit) of God and a purging of all impurities in the soul.    John claims that his knowledge of Jesus is through a revelation, and is not based on his own judgment: he did not know who Jesus was when he came to be baptized.  It is the revelation from God in two moments, the dwelling of divine Life (the Spirit) in Jesus and the attestation of God Himself: this is my Son.  Given the authority of the revelations given to John, John can affirm that he believes that Jesus is the Son of God - which affirmation is what the Evangelist hopes will be the attestation of all who read his Gospel.</p>    
					<p>A peculiarity of the Gospel is its focus on the desire for life.  Its claim is that life, if one really wants it, comes, especially if life eternal, from Jesus.  Thus, Jesus will say such things as: anyone who believes in me will not die, but will live forever.  The major works of Jesus in this Gospel all speak, in one way or another, of Jesus' power to give life; the culmination of this series of life-giving works is the final one, the raising of Lazarus from the dead.  Needless to say, what John the Evangelist shows about the public life of Jesus offers a sure means to interpretation of Jesus' crucifixion.  That is, in the light of his wisdom, power and holiness, it would be impossible to think that the crucified is a fool, impotent, and a criminal; there must be some other explanation for his crucifixion, an explanation that squares most fully with what Jesus' public life offers.     In this Gospel, the treatment of John the Baptist ends with our present Gospel; and our present Gospel ends with the profession: Jesus is divine Son of God, who will immerse his followers in the very life of God.  I should add that, while the Evangelist insists on the divinity of Jesus, he does so even though he does not explain the mystery of how it is that Jesus and God, apparently in Galilee two separate beings, are really two Persons in one God.  Yet, he affirms Jesus' divinity on every page. Finally, John presents Jesus as divine, not to convert non-believers, but to strengthen those already baptized and believing.  Indeed, all the New Testament is written for believers.</p>

					<h2>The Baptism of the Lord<br/>
					January 12, 2014, Year A</h2>
					<p>Isaiah 42:1-4, 6-7; Psalm 29:1-2, 3-4, 3, 9-10<br/>
					Acts 10:34-38; Matthew 3:13-17</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's first reading is the account of the first suffering servant song from the prophet Isaiah. The Lord God describes the personal characteristics of his servant. Who was this innocent servant who took upon himself the sins of others and befuddled scholars as the word of accurate Isaiah? At first he was taken to be the people of Israel as a whole; then he was thought to be an individual person. Finally many scholars believe him to be a prefiguring of Jesus Christ. He is pleasing to the Lord who called him forth into human existence. He is just for he has the Lord's spirit in him. He is meek and humble. He will be a light to the nations, for he is the Light of Life in the world. By his word he will set people free from their sins; his light will reveal our darkness. As the innocent One destined to die for the sins of others, he will accept baptism as the will of the Father and to be one with all sinners.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Each Gospel has its own way of dealing with Jesus' experience of baptism by John.  The fact that each Gospel does speak of this event shows its great importance for understanding the life of Jesus to follow in the rest of the Gospel.  It is significant that this story be the first event in the public life of Jesus for a reason we will see soon.   The Matthean baptism story is divisible into two parts: the dialogue between Jesus and John and the revelation, in two forms, from heaven.    It is difficult to prove that John would have been reluctant to baptize Jesus, for it is difficult to see, from these chapters leading up to this story, how John would have known that Jesus was so much greater than he.  It seems more reasonable to appeal to two elements which could produce our story.  First, Jewish rules of interpretation allow the Jewish Matthew to present events in their fullest meaning. Second, Christian faith, for many years before Matthew wrote (c. 85AD), worked out the correct relationship between John and Jesus, a relationship which was not so clear when John, the same age as Jesus  , was preaching repentance like Jesus.  However, we do know from Luke's account that on Mary's greeting of Elizabeth, the child in her womb leapt for joy. Faith and the mystical meaning of that exchange may be reason for John's statement that Jesus should baptize him. It is allowed then that faith and the 'rules' of the time express the truth of an event, though the data given are not actual; such is the effect of faith over the limitations of facts.</p>  
					<p>This Gospel suggests the problem about why Jesus would seek baptism; after all, faith has shown for years that Jesus was 'like us in all things but sin'.  The solution to this problem lies in the purpose of baptism; it is a public act, using water (the symbol in Israel of cleanliness and life), to manifest the baptized's intention of doing the will of God.  Such was the purpose of Jesus in coming to John - not that Jesus needed to repent, but he wished to manifest in a public way his intention to obey his Father.  It can also be said that Jesus, by being baptized by John, encourages others to have faith in John and do the same.</p>
					<p>The revelational aspect of Matthew's story is expressed by an act and a statement. The Holy Spirit, believed in for decades before the Gospel, showed itself in its coming to dwell in Jesus; this means that he will be guided by the Spirit for his future.  The word of God is meant to identify Jesus (in OT terms) as Messiah, the one anointed (=deputed) by God who finds Jesus to be a faithful child.  Note that we describe Jesus in his human nature, and experience; the Infancy Stories in Matthew have already pointed out his divine nature, that he is God.  It is now up to Jesus to work out what it means to be God's 'beloved son'; that will be understood after spending time in meditation in the desert for forty days.  The effect of all this is the public life of Jesus, empowered by the Spirit to cure and the preaching - and to obey in all circumstances.  After Jesus' baptism (and forty days in the desert) his role now is to announce the presence of God's longed-for kingdom and to call for the repentance that will allow one to enter that blessed kingdom.</p>

					<h2>The Epiphany of the Lord<br/>

					Ephesians 3:2-3a, 5-6; Mt 2:1-12</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>The birth of the babe at Bethlehem confirms with amazing accuracy the words and the faith of the prophet Isaiah, "Rise up in splendor, Jerusalem! Your light has come, the glory of the Lord shines upon you." His images are fitting for the royal Redeemer. Darkness covers the earth and thick clouds the minds and hearts of the people, but the Lord's glory shines on Jerusalem. "Lift up your eyes and look about you, they all come to you to be enlightened. The first visitors to the new-born King of the Jews, were humble shepherds keeping watch through the night. By contrast his second set of visitors where the learned men from the East. Unlike the political authorities of Jerusalem, threatened by the arrival of their new-born King, they worshipped him and bestowed on him kingly gifts.  The King of the world is welcomed by Gentiles to this humble house on earth. Are the Magi the already enlightened sons who come from afar and read the signs in the skies? Why are so many today in the dark? Are we unable to read the signs of the times in the skies.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>[Epiphany means revelation, making clear what was hidden.]  Matthew continues to prepare his reader for the adult life of Jesus by telling a story which reaches people who are not of Israel.  These people, represented by the Magi (= wise men, not kings), have revealed to them a phenomenon about which the heavens speak.  The Wise Men (throughout the centuries the number of Matthew's Wise Men reached seven) are those who dedicated their lives to uncovering the secrets about life and happiness which lie hidden in the heavens, on the earth or under the earth.  Certain wise men report their findings to the king of their country, who then acts on this new wisdom for the betterment of all the members of the kingdom; the happiness of the kingdom often depends on this wisdom.  In our story we meet Herod (the Great) and two of his sons: Archelaus and Antipas.  Herod, through the pleadings of his father in Rome, had his sons named as rulers of Israel to succeed him.  Archelaus ruled the bottom two-thirds of Israel, i.e. the sections of Judaea and Samaria; Antipater ruled the top third, i.e. Galilee.  It is useful to know that Herod the Great was at times maniacal: husband of nine wives, and murderer of many of his children.  It is he whom the Magi visit in Jerusalem, "to find out where the King of the Jews has been born".  It is useful to know that this was precisely the title Rome bestowed on Herod the Great: King of the Jews.  Hence, Herod's desire to kill Jesus.  Jesus was born two years or so before Herod the Great died; it was this Herod who killed the Bethlehem infants in hopes of killing Jesus.  Through God's intervention (no human judgment here), the Family escaped to Egypt where many Jews lived, to return not only after the death of Herod the Great (4BC), but also after Rome, in 6AD, removed Archelaus for his faults and replaced him with a series of Roman procurators.  Thus, the only Herod who ruled in Israel when Jesus was an adult was Herod Antipas; his brother had long given over rule of Judaea and Samaria to procurators, like Pontius Pilate.  What brought the Magi to Israel to look for 'the King of the Jews' was an unheard of movement of heavenly objects, perhaps planets, which Matthew prefers to know as a unique star.  The occurrence of this phenomenon in the heavens spoke to the Magi of something equally wonderful happening in a particular part of the earth, namely Israel.  The star, the Magi learn from their counterparts in Jerusalem, is a reference to the 'star' to arise in Bethlehem, as the prophecy has it.  There, they will find the new King.  The star, which had guided them to Jerusalem, now finishes its journey to lead the Wise Men to the place where Jesus was (a house, not a cave anymore).  Here, they give him extremely precious gifts, fit for a king; they are meant to seal an agreement of peace between the king of the Wise Men and this new king.  By this story Matthew shows that Jesus was meant to be king, not only over Israel, but over all kingdoms, even if currently pagan.  The ultimate point is: the authority behind the kingship of Jesus over all peoples is a divine decision, divinely revealed; there was no human thinking involved here.  God spoke through sign (star) and the Old Testament; there is no room then to doubt this truth about Jesus.</p>

					Colossians 3:12-27; or 3:`19`7; Mt 2:13-15, 19-23</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>On this solemnity today's readings define the quality of relationships between members of God's family. The coming of Jesus into the world gives God a chance to outline the coexistence of believing Christian persons. With Jesus in the Holy Family at Nazareth, God is in the world and the Christian family is in God. The father is in honor over his children; the mother's authority over her sons God confirms. The father and mother have equal authority over the children and are themselves equal partners. Who honors his father atones for sins and is heard when he prays; who reveres his mother stores up riches for himself. Who obeys his father brings comfort to his mother. God will not forget kindness done to one's father. The harmony of Jesus' family is a model for all Christian families which are meant to reflect the loving harmony between the Persons in the Blessed Trinity.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Magi were perpetual students in middle-eastern kingdoms; the best served the king.  Their knowledge was everything knowable, in the heavens, on earth and under the earth.  Their purpose was to provide as much knowledge (wisdom) as possible so that people and kingdoms might know what was necessary to have and maintain happiness, peace and prosperity.  It was understood that, to the person who knew how to read the mysteries of nature, truths were revealed which were unknown by ordinary people.  The Magi of Matthew read the heavens to say that a king was born to the east of their own country (we do not know what country is theirs.).  They knew this because, in their system of knowledge, the star (interpreted as 'king') appeared in a part of the heavens which had its parallel to Israel on earth.  Their king wisely sought peace with this newly born king by sending him extremely precious, rare gifts; the Magi were to be the representatives of the king for this gift-giving meant to affirm peace with the new king of Israel.  Matthew understands this star was meant to recall the prophecy about a 'star' that will arise in Judah to rule (= bring happiness to) Israel.  The Magi sought the exact dwelling of the new king, and, under the guidance of the OT, were told "in Bethlehem", the city of the greatest of the kings, David.  Herod the Great, whom the Magi consulted to find the new king's living quarters, wanted to kill this king: Herod, who died about two years after Jesus' birth, intended to kill the child, but the Magi, who were to tell Herod exactly where to find the child, returned home without seeing Herod again.   Through a series of dreams, which make strong use of the revelations concealed in the OT, Joseph, with his family, escapes to Egypt and remained there until he was told that Herod was dead (c. 4BC); with the aid of a dream, which used the OT, Joseph used his head and brought his family to the divinely predestined Nazareth (= probably 'the City of the Dedicated').  He went to Nazareth prudently, for to return to Bethlehem or Jerusalem would put his family under Herod's successor there, Herod Archelaus, who was a harsh and unbending ruler appointed by Rome, and removed by Rome after about ten years of poor governance.  That Joseph went to Egypt does not mean that he and his family lived in solitude; we know that about this time around one-fourth of Alexandria, the second largest city in the Roman Empire, was Jewish.     It is important to realize that these childhood stories of Jesus, valuable in themselves, really serve as introduction to the story of the adult Jesus.  Jesus was accepted and rejected because of his public life, not because of his birth; indeed, as Mark's Gospel indicates, there is no necessity to recite the childhood of Jesus; what is important is the correct understanding of the adult Jesus.  The childhood stories, therefore, have their value in that they are so thoroughly a revelation from heaven, than which there is no more certain source.  This thought includes God's sacred witness in the OT as well.  Thus, what the reader has as he begins to read about the adult Jesus is a host of ideas about Jesus, all of which have absolute certitude.  This situation is not that of Jesus' contemporaries, who constantly try, and fail, to understand who Jesus is.  Thanks to the childhood stories, the reader knows very well who Jesus is, and reads his story with the fullest understanding of the One in whom he has been baptized. [The Old Testament statement, "Out of Egypt I have called My son", was said about God's freeing (calling) His Israel (loved like a son) through Moses out of the slavery in Egypt; by Jewish rules of interpretation Matthew sees in that the OT statement spoke then in a hidden way, now in full clarity, a truth about Jesus.]</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Fourth Sunday of Advent.  Each Gospel has its own introduction; in Matthew, this introduction consists of his first two chapters, often called the Infancy Narratives.  Why does the Gospel have an introduction?  Consider that the historical figure of Jesus that was of interest to the people of Israel was the adult Jesus of Nazareth; it was this Jesus who preached, worked miracles and taught wisdom.  It was this public and adult Jesus whom people tried to interpret.  And it was this known figure that ultimately was judged and crucified.  In short, the adult, public Jesus is what each Gospel interprets for the benefit of its audience. [The audiences are as different from one another as is each Gospel different from one another.]  For better or for worse, the audiences of Jesus grasped only some of the meaning of Jesus; it is a given among many interpreters that Jesus' close followers really came to understand him at all fully only because of their lengthy reflection on the total life of Jesus which includes the resurrection; indeed, it is only the resurrection that is the final element to assure a proper assessment of the figure that passed through Galilee and Judaea in the 30's AD.  Given the lack of understanding shown throughout Jesus' public life, those who told the story of Jesus many years after his departure felt that their readers should be given a guideline, i.e. a proper understanding of Jesus, before his public life begins.  With this proper understanding, one knows exactly how to read the public life of Jesus, while the many figures he reads about do not know Jesus.     Matthew, like the Luke and John, used the kind of introduction that writers used in both the OT and in their Mediterranean world: the young years, if understood properly, hold the truth about the adult who will soon be described.  Thus, Matthew has chosen to enlighten his reader with stories of Jesus' youngest years and expects the reader to carry with him throughout the public life of Jesus what was told him in the Infancy Stories.  The question then is this: what does Matthew want his reader to know from Jesus' infancy so as to interpret the public and adult Jesus as perfectly, as truthfully, as possible?  First, this child is to be called 'God with us'; though this is not said by divine revelation, it is, in Christian understanding of the OT, a clear and direct claim that Jesus is Son of God, the clearest claim that one will find in all Matthew's Gospel.  Second,, the overwhelming flood of references to the OT is a strong argument that Jesus is the glorious flowering of the seed spread throughout the entire OT.  'The OT, through which God speaks, is completed by and in Jesus'; through God's word, revelation of a different sort from the angel, Matthew presents a certainty to the Jewish Christian audience of Matthew.  One cannot challenge the authority behind the statement that Jesus as the natural fulfillment of the OT.  Third, names are revelatory, especially if given by Heaven; thus, 'Jesus', which means 'God saves through the person bearing this name', is a definitive truth about the person very soon to take center-stage in the Gospel.  Two details:  First, according to Jewish law in Galilee of this time, Joseph and Mary, though not yet married, were legally bound to each other when they accepted an 'engagement'; thus, to leave Mary was a legal action, a public action - and  made Joseph anxious about how to 'put away Mary' without humiliating her.  What saved him was the revelation that Jesus had been conceived by superhuman means, which adds its own astounding truth about the meaning of Jesus.  Second, the central citation from Isaiah is, in transliterated Hebrew: imm - anu - el.  That is, imm means 'with', anu means 'us' and el means 'God'. </p>  
					<p>No one in the remaining part of the Gospel ever came close to knowing what the reader, thanks to Matthew's Infancy Stories, knows so fully and profoundly about Jesus.  The reader is thus advised by the author to bring with him, at every juncture of the Gospel, the revelation with which Matthew has armed him.  Only with what is contained in the Infancy Stories will one truly understand who Jesus is.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Today's Gospel returns us to the earthly side of God's garden. The world dominated garden is not spiritually cultivated; fear and doubt need to be replaced by faith and love. Jesus will use such times to teach the crowds about John the Baptist and the meaning of his mission. Matthew has already explained that John the Baptist is imprisoned; we know John was publicly critical of the ruling Herod Antipas, that son of Herod the Great, who, during Jesus' life ruled Galilee on behalf of the Romans.  For his criticism of Herod's illegal marriage to Herodias, John was put in prison, and could only hear of the many deeds Jesus was performing in the Galilean area.  Such was the talk among the people of Israel that John, like them, looked for the proper interpretation of this Jesus.  Matthew here calls him 'Messiah'; many call him 'prophet'; John wonders, and asks Jesus through John's disciples, "Are you the One who is to come?"  This title represents a phrasing of the Old Testament, which expected God's love for Israel to move God away from punishment of Israel for her sins to a renewal of His relationship described in the term 'Covenant', and summed up in the divine words to Moses, "I will be your God, and you will be My People".  Israel longed for someone to come from God to re-establish this relationship of total love and giving between these two covenant partners.  Isaiah is filled with prophecies assuring people of the certain return of all things to their original state, which is perfection.  This restoration is visible in the many cures of the sick, for thereby what was so imperfect has taken at least one step towards fulfilled perfection.  But who will represent God in this re-making of God's creation?  Jesus answers John's question, not with "I am this One who is to come", but with an invitation to look to his works: are not these the works of the perfecting God, and so of the One who is to come?  John's Gospel (ch 5) offers Jesus' works as one of five witnesses to his divine sonship; these works promise the re-making of the entire world.  Jesus concludes his answer to John by urging John to believe in Jesus; such is the meaning of the generality that blessed is the one who 'takes no offense' at me (i.e. blessed is John if he believes in me). </p>      
					<p>The scene changes; Jesus begins to walk, and now addresses the crowds.  John was highly regarded by many in Israel, having his own followers.  The judgment about him was that he was a prophet in Israel's midst, one of the long line of revered figures.  Jesus improves that opinion.  His argument pushes one to see that John is nothing of this world, that John is truly a voice used by God.  But, he is not simply 'another voice'; he is the final voice which prepares for the coming of Jesus.  As understood in the OT, this OT citation refers to the coming of God at the time of restoration of everyone and everything to perfection; Jesus makes clear that the citation is talking about Himself, the one who a moment earlier described himself to John as doing the works of God.  There is uniqueness about John, because there is a uniqueness of the coming for which he prepares.  That the time turns out not the final perfection of the world means little.  John will now introduce a world in which faith in Jesus will count more than all the blessings Israel had received, more than all the privileges Israel had enjoyed from God's unique love for Israel.  It is faith in Jesus that now will bring one to the kingdom.  John has been chosen to introduce the Divine, but each Israelite will be given the opportunity to choose to believe, and, in believing, will be greater than even John who, though the greatest of the prophets, is not yet a believer.</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>On that day, a shoot shall sprout from the stump of Jesse, and from his roots a bud shall blossom. Jesse is the father of David, that shoot, and Jesus the bud that blossomed from that shoot. On that day, is where we are in this season of Advent awaiting the coming of the Redeemer. With belief and knowing we await with longing the universal fulfillment of that day of the Lord. Those who repented, were baptized, and remained faithful need have no fear. He will not judge by appearance, but will judge the poor with justice. He will strike the ruthless with the rod of his mouth -- his word is truth. Justice shall be the band around his waist. Not violence, but peace shall rule the world. The wolf shall be a guest of the lamb; the calf and the young lion will browse together, with a little child to guide them. There will be no war on earth for it will be full of knowledge of the Lord. On that day the Gentiles shall seek him out, for his dwellings will be glorious. Such is the paradise the prophet Isaiah described long before John the Baptist appeared on earth. It is the heavenly kingdom he prefigured and helped prepared for his Lord, and for those who remain faithful to Jesus the Son of David, the Son of God and of Mary.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Given that John was a contemporary of Jesus, and that they preached the same essential message that Israel was to repent so as to enter God's Kingdom, there was understandably a problem: which of the two is the greater?  John had his followers, about whom we hear in 50AD, some 17 years after John's death.  Is such a personage the greatest of those who represented God?  The Christian Church said 'no', and John says 'no' -then who is he?  He is understood to be the greatest prophet (one through whom God speaks) in Israelite history; he prepares people for reunion with God after sin and prepares for the coming of the 'One who is to come', often called 'Messiah' (i.e. 'Christ' or 'King') of Israel.  And of singular significance is the fact that every Gospel feels it must start the story of God's new intervention (to make a new covenant) with Israel with the story of John.  It is with John that God begins His historic and long-awaited offer of peace, of reconciliation with sinful Israel.  A Gospel should not exist without John. the four Gospels testify.  John preached repentance; the repentant entered the waters of the Jordan river a sign and a prayer: a sign that indicated a change of moral life, and a prayer that God would wash away (and so water) sins and give new life, the life of the Covenant union (water also symbolized life).  The dress of John and his food are stark: they symbolize that he is not concerned with this life, but with offering reunion with God.  Clearly, John was very influential, as so many people, including Jesus, went to him to hear his word and be baptized.  Among those who came to him were the religiously and politically powerful, Sadducees and Pharisees; the former were also of the wealthy class.  True, these people, so utterly devoted to the Law, intended, as did John, that Israel repent.  However, as the Gospels witness, these leaders failed in important aspects of obedience to God, particularly respect for the neighbor and a love of wealth and position, of pride.  John demands of them obedience to the Law, and adds a further criticism: you trust that being children of Abraham, they ipso facto are 'just', i.e. will pass the final judgment.  John, echoing Paul and the early Church, insisted that circumcision is no sign of salvation, if it is not accompanied with obedience to the Law.  John was particularly aware that the final judgment was not far off; hence, the urgency for repentance now.  Israelites are reminded of what it means to say that the ax is ready to clear the ground of useless, i.e. fruitless, trees.  The winnowing fan is another sign of the separation of good from bad; that this fan is already in the hands of the "One who is to come" repeats the belief that Judgment is near.  Finally, John recognizes the presence of the "One who is to come", another description of the Messiah; such is the relationship of John to this Person that John knows he is not worthy to be even a servant (tying and untying sandals was the task of the servant for his master).  Above all, John's baptism cannot give what the baptism by the One who is to come will give.  Baptism in Greek means a dipping, here a dipping in the Jordan River or a dipping into the very holy life (Holy Spirit) of God.  He will also 'dip' the believer, the repentant, into fire, that element which destroys (evil) and purifies.  Thus, with Baptism one enters purified into the life of God; one has the Spirit of the believer.</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>The vision of the prophet Isaiah in today's reading invites us to enter into the house of the Lord. Easily recognizable it is built on the highest mountain. The nations of the world are invited to learn the ways of God that they may keep to his words. The Lord God will judge between the nations and shall impose terms on many peoples. Each group will have its particular characteristics to form one unity in God. The instruction will be on peace for the effects of this learning are such that people will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Men will not train for war and one nation will not attack another.  The invitation to climb the mountain of the Lord and so enter his house prepares us for the coming of the Lord and the accompanying events in today's Gospel.

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Jesus' entire public career was spent in 'calling the sinner to repentance'.   This willingness to repent was, in accord with the OT teachings, the means to enter the kingdom of God.  Jesus himself, called to seek repentance from sinners, announced that he had come to proclaim the kingdom of God, into which the repentant may enter.   Today's Gospel, speaking to the era of judgment, concentrates on the unexpectedness of the final judgment; no one knows the day or the hour when it will occur, not even Jesus, according to Matthew 24,36.  One must be prepared for the judgment, i.e. be in the condition of one who is repentant.</p>
					<p>To make clear the readiness one should have in order to have the Judge pass favorable judgment, Jesus uses three examples.  First, there is the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, when those two cities perished for their sins with the people in no way aware of the judgment they should face.  Swift was the punishment, upon those who were least ready for judgment.  Second, Jesus pictures two men in a field, two women grinding at the mill.  The suddenness of God's judgment will remove in a single swoop one of the two men and one of the two women.  The image Jesus wants here is that the Judge, i.e. the Son of Man, will leave behind (for punishment) those who would fail the final judgment, and accepts into the kingdom those who are at every moment ready for judgment.  Third, the daily awareness of possible theft always keeps one ready and alert for the thief; this is above all the case when owner of a house knows when the thief is coming: who would not be prepared?!?  In various ways Jesus argues the wisdom of readiness for judgment.  The judgment will come swiftly, at a moment not foreseen.  If one fails to realize this fact, he will end up with a judgment he could have avoided, if he had readied himself for the 'anytime coming' of the Son of Man.  If only he be ready, alert, he can be one of those 'taken' by the Son of Man, and not one of those 'left behind'.  One is wise only if he is prepared for the Lord; to know that he could come at any time, and yet not be ready for him, is foolishness.</p>
					<p>This Gospel is taken from a late chapter of Luke's Gospel, and is only a section of a much longer discourse of Jesus about the 'end time', a subject very much on the mind of Israelites of Jesus' time; indeed, most prophets over the centuries were preoccupied by the fact that some day God must right all wrongs, and when He does, evil in all its forms will be swept away for those who are pleasing to Yahweh.  The Church puts this teaching of Jesus as a first consideration, as one prepares for the coming of the Lord on Christmas Day.  One knows the day and the hour now, and so, the Church urges everyone to be prepared for God's entry into our world.</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron. They were bone of David's bone, flesh of his flesh. They approved him as a product of God's work as Adam had approved Eve as a work of God in the Book of Genesis. David had led the Israelites out as a people oppressed and back again as victors over their enemies. God had promised that David would shepherd Israel as a shepherd guides his sheep, and in that way he would command his people. In Israel the king was meant to be a man of integrity, wise and holy. The elders ware about to keep God's  promise to David. They anointed him their king, the one chosen by God, through the people, to lead. The commentary on today's Gospel gives a clear description of the meaning and background of 'King' in Israel's history. </p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>In our Gospel this weekend, Jesus is on the cross.  Because of the title over his head on the upright wooden beam, "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews", the crucifying soldiers (of the Roman army, but not necessarily Roman citizens) mockingly address the crucified as 'King' and suggest that he do what would be expected of a king: exercise his power to free himself from this imminent death.  Actually, the jeering Roman soldiers think of 'king' in their own terms: kings or emperors they have heard of in the Mediterranean countries of their time.  For a Jew, however, 'king' meant not only one with supreme power, but also a person who was wise and holy, i.e. one who has God on his side.  Ever since the time of David (most notably), Jews, except for a short period of time, knew only kingship.  In particular, they knew the value of their kings, for the people's well-being and happiness was directly dependent on the power, wisdom and holiness of their kings.  Should the king be weak in any of these three categories, his people suffered greatly.  The two terrible exiles in Jewish history, that in 722BC under the Assyrians and that in 587BC under the Babylonians, are the starkest, though far from the only, results of sinful, foolish and weak kings.  Indeed, when Israel, in its many times of suffering, looked for help from its covenant Partner, Israel thought in terms of the most perfectly powerful, wise and holy king possible, one who could overcome all dangers.  Because the official act by which a person becomes king is an anointing with oil, he got the title Messiah, for Messiah in Hebrew means 'anointed' (and in Greek it means Christos). Thus, when Jesus entered into his public ministry, the people were already primed to look for a Messiah, a King, who could save them from all evil - for some, this saving meant a saving from Roman domination in particular.  Though the charges against Jesus as he stood before the Jewish authorities did not include 'claiming to be the king', when Jesus was presented to Pilate, the most serious charge was that Jesus disturbed the peace Rome demanded and pretended to be the people's king; indeed, many followed Jesus not only because he seemed like a prophet from God, but also because they saw and heard from Jesus made them think of him as the promised king, Son of King David, his ancestor. </p>        
					<p>The criminals crucified with Jesus are Jewish; thus, they do not think of Jesus as king in the secular, gentile manner; the one ridicules him as one deserving of death, not as the Christ or Messiah.  The other thinks of Jesus as his Messiah, who will rule with such power and wisdom and as friend of God that he will save from all threats to happiness.  His faith in the identity of Jesus means that Jesus, king, does have a kingdom; the present circumstances argue that Jesus will enter his kingdom only after he dies.   The 'good criminal' has every hope that Jesus will receive him into Jesus' kingdom where he rules and provides perfect happiness.  'Paradise' is a term, in origin referring to an enclosed, controlled space, but in time referring to a garden (enclosed) which flourishes (no weeds or ugliness here, just beauty, life, peace).  It was not too many years after the passing of Jesus that his followers, because they claimed that the best way to define Jesus was to say he was 'Messiah' or 'King' or 'Anointed', became known as 'Christians', those in allegiance to Christ, King, Messiah, the Anointed One; their future will be in the kingdom of God.</p>
					<h4>Reflection</h4>
					<p><b>In the first reading the Jewish people wanted and received an earthly king. Events since then have indicated to many that Christ is a heavenly king. He did not come down from the Cross for anyone, but he rose from the dead for all.</b></p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>We are two weeks away from Advent, the beginning of a new liturgical, church year.  This Sunday and the Sunday following excerpt sayings of Jesus about a concern of all Israel in his lifetime, namely, the end of this world as we know it.  These readings coincide with Luke's attention to the final days of Jesus' own life: he is finally in Jerusalem, to die and then to live forever.  It is always good to keep in mind that Luke has thought it valuable to repeat for his audience of 80-85AD what Jesus had said to his own audience some fifty years earlier; Jesus' words had meaning, Luke thinks, for his own Christian group.   Note first that this story starts with an engaging pair of questions from people: when will the destruction of the Temple (Jerusalem) happen and what about all the things that are to happen before the end of this world; it is evident that the destruction of the Temple is considered by the people as one of the events which brings this world to an end.  Jesus speaks here as a teacher of wisdom, turning the admiration of people at the site of the glorious Temple into a sombre warning of its total destruction.  One might think he is speaking merely from an historical point of view; rather, he is, like the people, seeing the destruction of the Temple as a part of God's plan to end this world.  Luke does not have Jesus dwell on the Temple's destruction.  He knows that, at the time of his writing, that the Temple had been destroyed for at least ten years.  Rather, Luke has Jesus move to remark about the 'other things' about which he was asked, especially in their relation to final destruction of the world; this concern to recognize the future signs of the approaching end is more important than the past events signalling this approach.</p>
					<p>Luke knows that over the years since Jesus' death many people have claimed to be able to predict the end of the world.  The usual approach to these predictions is to clothe the future in the same or similar terms which the ancient Hebrew prophets had so often, in their own times, used to speak about the coming justice of God and final punishment of Israel's enemies.  Luke's concern, however, is not to have Jesus predict the timing or types of signs which precede and announce the coming end; rather, he denies the significance given to wars and other sufferings (all part of the expectations of Israel) and warns the disciples not to be tricked by them: the end is not near, though there be sufferings usually identified as forecasting that the end is at hand.  What Luke attends to is the challenge, through all sufferings (especially persecutions for the faith with which his audience is very familiar), that Christians not deny their faith in Christ.  The 'end-time', so much on the minds of Jesus' audience, is not on Luke's mind here: rather, what moves him is the desire to encourage fidelity in a world of trial and persecution, no matter how close or far is the end of the world.  The words of Jesus Luke relays to his audience speak of terrible sufferings, even the betrayal by relatives and friends.
					Before these things happen we will be handed over to synagogues and prison because of Jesus' name. We must not prepare a defense beforehand, for Jesus himself will give us a wisdom against our adversaries they will be powerless to resist or refute. Luke reminds his audience that to be faithful to God's word is important, then God will look after those who persevere.</p>

					<p>But, as is usual with Luke, concentration ends, not on negative experiences, but on virtue, here the virtues of perseverance and trust, confidence that the love God has for His People will overcome any and all challenges to faith and the obedience it demands. </p>  
					<h4>Reflection</h4>
					<p><b>To exist as a human person and to know Jesus Christ the God-Man in faith are God's first gifts. The great gifts of his commandments are to love God with all my heart, soul, and strength, and my neighbor as myself!</b></p>

He received them as gifts from God, he will gladly return them in sacrifice, for God's gifts do not return to him empty. The fourth son is tortured in the same way. Near death he said to his killers that he was glad to die at the hands of men, for he had the God-given hope of being raised up by God. His gifts of freedom and hope he returned through sacrifice that he may rise to new life through his yet-to-be-born Messiah.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>The Sadducees are best known to us for their denial of an afterlife or resurrection from the dead and of heavenly rewards and punishments.  Their views were buttressed by their conviction that divine revelation is to be found only in the first five books of the OT, the Mosaic Torah, the Pentateuch - and only through a most conservative reading of those books.  The rest of the OT is valuable, but does not contain revelation.        The Gospel story today is actually an argument against resurrection from the dead and offers Jesus' response to that argument, especially drawing truth from the very books in which the Sadducees say there is no teaching that we will rise from the dead.  They believe they can prove Jesus is wrong about resurrection from the dead by virtue of a story, which if followed logically, makes the afterlife ridiculous, thereby showing through ridicule that there is no reason to say that we will rise to new life after death.  Their argument is based on a law from the book of Leviticus; in it is stated that a woman, should she not have had a child before her husband dies, must be married by the deceased's 'brother-in-law' so that she can produce a child.  The Sadduceean story creates the need for seven men to marry the woman so that she have a child.  Note that what is at stake here is a law to insure the preservation of the people of Israel; it was the hope that every woman could contribute to this preservation.  From their story the Sadducees draw, in question form, their conclusion: which of the seven will be her husband in this so-called life after death; after all, she had seven husbands on earth. Jesus answers that there will be no need for the preservation of the people of Israel in the next life, because there will be no death, and thus no need for a substitute to keep Israel in existence. Having children, in the narrow sense, is the means of overcoming death and keeping Israel alive; in the afterlife, like angels who are undying, there will be no death and so no need to have children.  That Moses agrees with Jesus can be seen from a citation from the very books most cherished by Sadducees; thus, Jesus answers them in their own terms.  Moses spoke of God as 'the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob'.  This saying does not say that God was the forefathers' God, but that He is their God; since He is their God, and since God is a God only of life, to say that He is God of the forefathers, even though they had died, is to say that they rose from the dead.  God is not God of the dead, but of the living.  Not only then do the Sadducees not understand the meaning of Scripture, but they do not understand who their God really is: all people, dead or alive, are always alive to Him.  Why? because He loves them.  The story is a challenge to Luke's readers to realize that nothing will separate them from God, not even death; Luke thinks the story is worth  repeating, not just an historical event, but as truth valid for his own readers to embrace. </p>     
					<h4>Reflection</h4>
					<p><b>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are heroes of the Old Testament alive in Jesus. As members of the New Testament are we heroes living for/in Jesus? After death?</b></p>

					<p>Wisdom 11:22-12:2; Psalm 145:1-2, 8-9, 11-12, 13-14<br/>
					2 Thessalonians 1:11-22; Luke 19:1-10</p>
 
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today the Book of Wisdom tells us that the whole creation is as a grain from a balance, or a drop of morning dew come down upon the earth, but then, the Lord can do all things. He overlooks peoples' sins that they may repent. God's loving mercy is meant to provoke repentance for he loves all that he created. If God hated he would not have created, for to create is to show loving goodness. How could we remain if God did not call us into existence, and how could we grow into maturity without his loving support? He gently rebukes those who sin and calls them to repentance by reminding them of their offenses.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Though so close to the desert, Jericho was like an oasis lying, as it did below sea level, and was a logical place for caravans crossing from the Far East, through Damascus and Palestine to Egypt and other African centers. For a person like Zacchaeus it was an ideal setting to make a very comfortable living as a tax-and toll-collector for hated Rome.  He was a 'chief tax-collector' because others worked under him in their nefarious business over a wide area. That Zacchaeus was short, and thus needed to climb a tree in order to see Jesus does not lead one to think that Zacchaeus has a spiritual yearning. That Jesus, however, stops to speak to this Zacchaeus in public, saying that he intends to stay at his house, is 'spiritual', i.e. the intent behind Jesus' words is to call Zacchaeus to repentance.  Actually, Jesus' words include '.it is necessary that I stay in your house'.  Both 'necessary' and 'to stay' are key words for Luke: the first points to the divine will that Jesus must do or say something and the second is more than just a visit - it is to remain, a longer and more significant presence in a person's house and life.  Thus, Jesus' call is unexpected on the part of Zacchaeus who only wants to catch a good glimpse of a famous person , but part of the divine plan that Zacchaeus be given the chance to repent and the chance to let Jesus have a permanent place in his life.</p>  

					<p>Jesus' words to Zacchaeus are loud enough to be heard by the crowds and this detail sets the scene in which many complain that Jesus is breaking Tradition by associating in a forbidden way (entering his house); such familiarity is forbidden for it is, as the OT teaches, a common way for Jews to lose their religious alliance with Yahweh and become pagan.  No good ever comes, they say, from such a close association.  This complaint, heard so often in Jesus' public life, yields two crucial statements.  On the one hand, Zacchaeus. shows publicly his repentance by a return of monies which he stole; the amount was already determined by the OT rules of repentance.  On the other hand, Jesus explains that nothing less than salvation has come to Zacchaeus, thus showing that Jesus is more than a prophet (prophets would only announce the nearness of salvation) and is the key to salvation, and at the same time explaining why he is willing to break rules of Tradition: this is a son of Abraham a child who should be partner with God in covenant, the object of the same love which chose Abraham and his offspring forever - Jesus HAD to seek Zacchaeus.' repentance.</p>

					<p>The story closes, not with harmony among all its characters, but with the adamant profession of Jesus: the Son of Man has come to seek out and to save what was lost. Zacchaeus. only wanted to see a famous person; Jesus must seek out, like the shepherd and the woman in earlier parables, in order to save what was lost.  The story is a pleasant conversion story, but also finally a defense story, as Luke builds up his argument that Jesus, now so close to Jerusalem and condemnation, has done nothing wrong.</p>
					<h4>Reflection</h4>
					<p><b>Many of us are like Zacchaeus not yearning for spiritual things. Do we allow Jesus, the Good Shepherd to seek us out because we belong to him?</b></p>

					<p>Sirach 15:12-14, 16-18; Psalm 34:2-3,17-18, 19, 23<br/>
					2 Timothy 4:6-8:16-18; Luke 18:9-14</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's reading continue to deal with prayer, but this time attitude is emphasized over perseverance and words. The God of justice has no favorites, but he has tendencies towards those in need who cannot fend for themselves. Prayer is meant to come from one's needs. To know his needs and know himself aids one's disposition in prayer one ought pray willingly and with acceptance of the needs which drive him to pray. Man's humanity determines his stance before God; his freedom gives him the choice to accept or reject it. The Book of Sirach confirms our just God's leanings towards the poor and lowly. He is partial towards the weak and hears the cry of the oppressed. He is not deaf to the plight of the orphan and the widow -- those without security in a male world. The Lord will affirm justice and will respond quickly to those who ask.</p>

					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
					<p><b>The Lord hears the cry of the poor.</b></p>

					<p>The Lord is close to the broken hearted; <br/>
					and those who are crushed in spirit he saves. <br/>
					The Lord redeems the lives of his servants; <br/>
					no one incurs guilt who takes refuge in him. <b>Response</b></p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>As is so often the case with Luke's Gospel, it is the circumstances with which Luke introduces a story that give the key to understanding Jesus' intentions.  To introduce Jesus' story we read this Sunday, Luke cites Jesus' own words: he who defined his public life as that of one sent to call people to repentance now speaks about those 'who were convinced of their own righteousness and despised everyone else'.</p>

					<p>The parable describes two figures, the Pharisee and the tax collector (this latter belonged to a group which cheated in the collection of taxes owed to Rome and was despised as both cheats and collaborators with the occupying forces of Rome).  Both men are praying in the Court of the Men.  Most church Sanctuaries today are against a wall; such was the position of the Temple room known as the Holy of Holies.  The room leading into this sacred dwelling of Yahweh is called the Holies; here only certain priests were allowed to enter (the High Priest is the only person who could enter the Holy of Holies, and that only one day a year).  Outside the Holies was the Court of the Men and Priests.  It is most likely here that we should place the Pharisee and the tax collector, both facing the eastern end of the Temple, the Holy of Holies.  This Court was spacious enough that the Pharisee kept himself quite private from the tax collector.  The text says that the Pharisee either stood alone, apart, or prayed by himself; it is not clear what Luke intended here, except to say that the Pharisee took a position that separated him from the sinner. </p>

					<p>The content of the Pharisee's prayer is praiseworthy; Mosaic Law would be pleased with such obedience.  Indeed, since the Mosaic Law prescribes fasting on everyone once a year, the Pharisee can be commended for fasting more than was necessary.  Most all of what the Pharisee says is traceable and recommended in the OT.  His problem is not what he does; his problem is that he saw himself as sinless, righteous, admitting no sin on his part, and then despising others for their sinfulness.  The error of the vain and boastful Pharisee is that he thinks himself without sin, that he is worthy to stand before God, while despising others he believes to be sinners.  The tax collector is so described (not raising his eyes [a sign of unworthiness], but beating his breast [an admission of guilt and contrition]) that he points to repentance as the proper result of contrition.  Jesus approves the latter: he admits he is not righteous, and in no way is seen as despising others.  The combination of pride and condemnation of others leaves the reader with the lesson that the Pharisee will not be forgiven, but that the sinner will be (or, as some scholars read the text, one will be less forgiven that the other who is totally forgiven.  Certainly, the parable does not teach that good deeds are worthless; nor does it teach that sorrow for sin, with no repentance thereafter, is justifying.  It means to illustrate the teaching that one should not glorify oneself while despising others; it falls to God, who alone knows the heart of the Pharisee and the tax-collector, to identify the one who is just in His sight, and who is not.  I can and should know only myself.</p>

					<p><b>The parable of Jesus presumes that people pray. Is my attitude that of the Pharisee or the tax collector?</b></p>

					<p>Exodus 17:8-13; Psalm 12:1-4, 5-8<br/>
					2 Timothy 3:14-4:2; Luke 18:1-8</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's readings deal with prayer; but specifically with perseverance in prayer, that the prayer may be answered. The Amalekites and the Israelites, once they met, continued in a warring relationship until Israel eventually eliminated the tribe of Amalek. This they needed to do in order to enter Canaan the land promised to their fathers. For Moses the winning of the battle is not the engagement of Amalek, but the raising of his staff held hand to God. The engagement must take place but the winning or losing depended on the perseverance of Moses as we have seen. He needed the help of his friends, so belonging to a community is important. With members cooperating victory is guaranteed, and God's response will be certain and may be swift. His promise made to the fathers of Israel will be fulfilled.</p>

					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
					<p><b>Our help is from the Lord who made heaven and earth.</b></p>

					<p>I lift up my eyes toward the mountain;<br/>
					whence shall help come to me? <br/> 
					My help is from the Lord,<br/>

					<p>May he not suffer your foot to slip;<br/>

					<p>The Lord will guard you from all evil;<br/>
					he will guard your life. <br/>
					The Lord will guard your coming and your going,<br/>
					both now and forever. <b>Response</b></p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>As in so many stories told by Luke, Luke's own setting of the scene is very significant; in this case, the call to pray always and never giving into weariness helps interpret the parable. </p>
					<p>Of itself, the parable has two main characters: the judge and the widow.  The former is known as 'unjust', paying no attention to God or man, and the latter is one of the lowest class of citizens in all Israel.  The contrast could not be greater, and is intentional.  Historically, such a scene, though a bit extreme, is not impossible; it resonates as true to the audience of Jesus.  Because direct address is given to the judge, one might expect that, literally speaking, the judge is the main character.  On the contrary: the initial Lucan setting of the parable argues that the widow is the main character.  Jesus does draw attention to the words of the judge, but it is persistent prayer, unwearied prayer, that wins the day.</p>
					<p>Jesus makes clear what he wants to be the meaning of his parable.  His teaching places in contrast the imagined unjust judge and the real recipient of prayer, God.  If the unjust can be moved to act justly, surely God, the supremely Just One, will answer persistent requests.  But, then, Jesus offers further reflection, based on his knowledge of God: He will answer those who trust in Him, and He will answer swiftly.  Thus, now in contrast is the conviction of Jesus that God will not always wait to hear persistent prayer; on His part, He will often act as His love moves Him - swiftly.  Jesus' words at this time are put in question form: he asks his audience, from its knowledge of God revealed, to judge how God will act towards those who love him: is He not great-hearted, merciful?  Though teaching, Jesus often hopes to achieve his goal by asking his audience to 'achieve' it for him.</p>
					<p>The Son of Man as a statement is very much in character with Jesus' thinking: he knows the danger of the struggle to believe.  That the Son of Man is used indicates that Jesus' return will be that of a returning Judge of the world; the earliest form of Son of Man is that of Judge of all.  Faith here refers to that commitment to truth which is the basis for persevering prayer: to persevere takes great conviction and determination.  Will the faithful be convinced and determined till the very end?</p>

					<h2>Twenty-eighth Sunday in Ordinary Time<br/>
					October 13, 2013, Year C</h2>
					<p>2 Kings 5:14-18; Psalm 98:1, 2-3, 3-4<br/>   
					2 Timothy 2:8-13; Luke 17:11-19</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's readings deal with healing of the body and of the soul. The lepers cast out from community are cleansed and can return to loved ones among the people of God. At the word of Elisha Naaman plunges seven times into the Jordan and was cleansed of his leprosy. This Syrian returned to the door of Elisha to thank him for his healing. He now knows that "there is no God in all the earth except in Israel." He will offer sacrifices to no other God except the Lord. Jesus on his way to his death and resurrection at Jerusalem passed through the alien territory of Samaria and Galilee. On entering a village ten lepers met him. From a distance they raised their voices, "Jesus, Master! Have pity on us." Jesus looked at them, and told them to go show themselves to the priests. On their way they were cleansed; one, a Samaritan, realizing that he was cleansed returned to thank Jesus. He asked, "Ten were cleansed, were they not?"</p>
					<p>Jesus on 'his way' shows us what it means to be on 'our ways' to the resurrection. As Scripture says, Jesus is 'the way', and the one who takes up his cross, takes it up because he follows Jesus to glory. </p> 

					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
					<p><b>The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power. </b></p>

					<p>Sing to the Lord a new song,<br/>
					for he has done wondrous deeds,<br/>
					his right hand has won victory for him,<br/>
					his holy arm. <b>Response</b></p>

					<p>The Lord has made his salvation known;<br/>
					in the sight of the nations he has revealed his justice.<br/>
					He has remembered his kindness and his faithfulness<br/>
					toward the house of Israel. <b>Response</b></p>

					<p>All the ends of the earth have seen<br/>
					the salvation by our God.<br/>
					Sing joyfully to the Lord, all you lands;<br/>
					break into song; sing praise. <b>Response</b></p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>At this point in his presentation, Luke tells of a teaching of Jesus given by Jesus through means of a miracle he generously performs for ten lepers.  Some interpreters find fault with Jesus in this story, because he must first be asked, and does not perform the miracle on his own.  Such certainly was not the meaning Luke intended here.  But this opinion does remind us that the daily purpose of Jesus was not miracle working, but calling people to repentance.  There must be, in Luke's thought, the right balance between a Jesus who can and does work miracles, even forgiving sins, and his calling as one who should ask all for repentance.  Though this Gospel is filled with miracles, signs of the birth of the kingdom of God in Israel, Luke knows that, when all is said and done, Jesus has come to call sinners to repentance.</p>
					<p>Literarily, the miracle is not described; we only know that somewhere it occurred - an indication that it is not the main point at issue here.  Important are the instructions of Jesus, that these cured people should present show themselves to a priest or priests in the Jerusalem Temple area.  Why should they do this?  Because the Mosaic Law makes the word of the priest the assurance to the rest of Israel that 'what was unclean is now clean' and will no longer be a threat to the purity of the worship of God; if there is no priestly assurance, there is no acceptance of the 'unclean' by the worshipping people at its liturgies.  The priest does not cure; he authenticates the truth of a cure and subsequent purity.</p>
					<p>Jesus cannot tolerate the fact that only one leper, cured, returned to him to thank God.  Some scholars see in this a polemic that Israel is ungrateful for so much, that the non-Jew will be willing to admit the action of God in his life - a prelude to the spread of Christian discipleship beyond Israel to the Gentiles.  This grateful non-Jew is a Samaritan, and so in principle a determined enemy of Israel, who lives between Galilee and Judea.  Samaritans expected One from God, whom they called Taheb, or Revealer, and not Messiah as in Israel.  The Samaritan seems to think that God, not Jesus, cured him (though Luke thinks differently), but he is grateful to Jesus as the Revealer of the power of God and so returns to him gratefully.  The final and crucial lesson of this story is now stated (and its wording is found often elsewhere in the Gospel): your faith has set you free.  Faith in God, faith in Jesus - knowing who is God and what Jesus is, and embracing that knowledge with one's full will - that is freeing, saving.  Gratitude follows upon blessing; salvation follows upon truth (who is the true God) and total love for and trust in Him.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>The words of Jesus in today's Gospel are part of a long speech Luke offers, in which he has presented the eloquent parable of the rich man and Lazarus in last week's Gospel.  Jesus' point there was to underline his experience that so hard-hearted can one become that he will not repent even if someone returns from the dead to report the terrible suffering caused by selfishness.  The words of Moses will be enough to bring about repentance, if one will only listen trustingly to his words. </p>
					<p>It is shortly after this parable that Jesus speaks of faith, a faith so solid and undoubting and trusting that even the seemingly most improbable (uprooting of the mulberry tree) can happen. The reason the most unlikely will happen is not the faith itself, but the person in whom one has faith.  Faith in the wrong person will yield nothing astounding. </p>
					<p>In last week's text the rich man had faith in his wealth. The week before the steward who cheated on his master trusted in his worldly friends to help him save face. Even with faith we fall short of God's vision for us.</p>
					<p>But, on the other hand, if the one believed in is truly believed in, then faith will fulfill its natural goal. The NT faith, built as mentioned above on the intellect, as reasonable and intelligible, believes the object of faith to be such as to be absolutely worthy of all trust.</p>
					<p>Faith, then, is both belief in something as true, but also totally sure of the goodness of the reality it believes exists.</p>
					<p>Finally, as the word 'faith' is used at times in the NT, it can be understood not as perfect faith, but beginning faith; e.g. the disciples, after the miracle of changing water into wine at Cana, 'believed' in Jesus; i.e. they began to believe in him - thus, degrees of faith (and trust) are contained in the NT's use of 'faith'.</p>
					<p>In our Gospel, Jesus wants the perfect faith, which means a faith that God can do (and, knowing His love, will do) what is most unlikely in human existence (uproot the mulberry bush and plant it in the sea).</p>
					<p>Following his word about 'faith' is a question which, in story form, ultimately teaches that 'faith' is really and finally owed to God, that it is not something beyond our duty.  Our faith is a free choice of our own, but it is owed to God, and we can see this duty ever more clearly as we move through all His creation and consider our redemption, and realize that our perfect happiness is only when we can live with Him undisturbed and forever.  There are enough reasons, Jesus thinks, to move from what the mind can understand to embrace in certitude what we, by thinking alone, cannot affirm to be certain.</p>

					1 Timothy 6:11-16; Luke 16:19-31 </p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Last week, the 25th., in ordinary time, the readings dealt with right attitudes and behavior in the matter of wealth. Today's, 26th. Sunday readings, continue that same theme but with an important difference. The exhibition of wealth and abuse of another is carried out passively. The Pharisees who had heard Jesus last week, scoffed at his Old Testament reasoning; it ended with John the Baptist. A new era was beginning. The chief steward who robbed his master and then further stole from him by giving his worldly friends "good deals" with reduced debts was with the new times. It was good business for merchants to fix their scales to rob the poor and lowly and sell to them the refuse of the wheat. </p>
					<p>The passive abusers of wealth this week are complacent in Zion. They eat lambs taken from the flock and calves from the stall. Lying on beds of ivory and stretched comfortably on their couches they improvise to the music of the harp and, like David, devise their own accompaniment. In this state of ill-gotten wealth, of indulgence and indifference, they care little for the ills of Jacob. </p>

					but the way of the wicked he thwarts. <br/>
					The Lord shall reign forever; <br/>
					your God, O Zion, through all generations. <b>Response</b></p>
					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>In today's Gospel Jesus gives an example of wealth lived in thoughtless unawareness of others and the soft life it can cause. "There was a rich man who dressed in purple garments and fine linen and dined sumptuously each day." Lazarus was a poor man who lay at his door covered with sores who would gladly have eaten the scraps from the rich man's table. Dogs came and licked his sores. When he died he was carried by angels to the bosom of Abraham. Looking up from the depths of the netherworld the rich man saw Lazarus with Abraham. How different the reversal of locations and states; the kingdom of heaven is not at all like the kingdom of earth for both. The rich man cried out; "Father,  Abraham have pity on me. Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water to cool my tongue, for I am suffering torment in these flames." Impossible! A great chasm exists between Lazarus and the rich man who received good when on earth while Lazarus received what was bad, but now he is comforted here. The rich man insisted, then send him to my father's house, for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they come here. But they have Moses and the prophets, said Abraham. Let them listen in them. No, the brothers are like their rich brother and will not listen. They would not listen even if one were to rise from the dead. It's the nature of mankind to try to be his own god. It is not possible; we are creatures of God and we belong to him. He wants what is his, so he sent us his only Son Jesus to show us the way through obedience. And still, most will not serve. Interesting, that in the parable the earthly Jesus, before dying, should mention, "rising from the dead" and "life after death." Lazarus is contented in the bosom of Abraham, while the rich man is in torment in the netherworld, because he had it good during his life on earth and cared nothing for others. The great divide between the two that cannot be crossed, means that choosing has ended. Eternity is set; through our freedom on earth we have made our choice for eternity. "The God who created us without our permission will not save us without our permission" (St. Augustine).</p>

					1 Timothy 2:1-8; Luke 16:1-23 or 16:10-13 </p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's readings deal with right attitudes and behavior  in the matter of wealth. The Old Testament prophet Amos  demands the attention of those who, "trample upon the needy and destroy the poor of the land." They ask, "When will the new moon be over that we may sell our grain, and the sabbath, that we may display the wheat?" The season of cheating people will have arrived when they can fix their scales to rob the poor of what little they posses. The poor and lowly are the victims of those who wheel and deal in the world. They can sell even the refuse of wheat and whatever other produce is left over. These dishonest opportunists are the success stories of the world who gloat over their wealth and position. The vulnerability of the little people is to be exploited and taken advantage of, but the Lord has warned the swindlers of the past and the users of today: "By the pride of Jacob; never will I forget a thing they have done." Know of the judgment to come!</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>The Gospel reading continues the themes of abuse of wealth and manipulation of people by people. The steward of a good and upright employer was found to be squandering his master's property. The employer had learned from a reliable source that he was being robbed. In justice he called the offender to give an account of his dealings. The steward offered no defense and immediately began to connive how to save face by further stealing from his employer. We are not told anything of the steward's earlier life. Was he originally a person of integrity who became seduced by the power of his position? We saw that power and cunning in how he dealt with his master's debtors. He had considerable talent but  little appetite for manual work. His strategy is still effective in today's world where technology gives quick access to profits for quick thinkers. The apparent ease with which the debtors of the owner accepted their reduced debts reminds us that mankind has changed little over centuries. The world has changed as a result of man's initiative, functionality and response to money which opens the door to comfortable living, but interior man is drowning in the wake of scientific progress. He still wonders and thinks, but doesn't quite believe, that he can do without God. </p>
					<p>In the parable Jesus gently but firmly emphasizes that sharing wealth is constitutive of Christian behavior. The dismissed servant shares his master's wealth with his debtors, but he shared it selfishly: "What's in it for me?" Jesus commended the steward for saving himself with others of worldly wisdom and contrasts him with the sons of light. They, however, are not unlike the steward and ought to make friends with worldly wealth, but he expects them to fail. Then when the worldly wealth fails, the worldly Christian, with a converted heart, will be welcomed into eternal dwellings. Because, "If you are not trustworthy with what belongs to another, who will trust you with what is yours?" Through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, eternal life in God is ours, but we must claim it as our own by sharing God's gifts as Jesus did.</p>

					1 Timothy 1:12-17; Luke 15:1-32 or 15:1-10 </p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>The Lord said to Moses, "Go down at once to your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, for they have become depraved." They had turned away from the way the Lord God had pointed out to them -- to keep his commandments. They were making for themselves a molten calf and worshipping it, sacrificing to it and crying out, "This is your God, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt." The Lord saw how stiff-necked the people were and wanted to destroy them. They were creatures of the earth, people of Moses and not of God. They did not keep God's commands and wanted to be like God. They will not serve. Such pride is not unique to humans; Lucifer and his angels refused to obey and did not serve God. Moses pleaded with the Lord God in the names of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to be faithful to his promise, that their descendants would be as numerous as the stars in the sky. This land he would give to their descendants as their perpetual heritage. "So the Lord relented in the punishment he had threatened to inflict on his people."</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to Jesus to listen to him. Some Pharisees and scribes complained that Jesus ate and drank with sinners. They were looking for reasons to find fault with him. Perhaps they were jealous of his popularity, and fearing the loss of their political position, felt threatened. In any event, their intention was malicious; they were spoiling for a disagreement. Jesus greets their resentment by telling them a parable about the joy of a shepherd who found his sheep which had strayed. Upon returning home he called his friends together to help him celebrate the return of his lost sheep. Jesus compares the shepherd's joy to that of the angels in heaven celebrating the return of a sinner who repents. </p>
					<p>Did the Pharisees and scribes recognize themselves as the lost sheep in Christ's parable? The crowds are the flock who have not yet grasped the full meaning of Jesus' message, and so, do not have the wit to stray. Unlike the scribes and Pharisees they do not have any position of importance to lose and do not believe that Jesus is the Messiah and savior of his people. They will stay with him while he feeds them and works miraculous healings. When Jesus asks for a commitment to follow him by keeping his commandments, then they will decide for themselves where their future lies. Our present world is not that different from when Jesus walked on earth. We too must decide whether or not to keep the words of Jesus and do the Father's will and like Jesus return home. We too have the grace to choose where we will spend our future eternity.</p>

				<p>Wisdom 9:13-18b; Psalm 90:3-4, 5-6, 12-13, 14-17 <br/>
				Philemon 9-10, 12-17; Luke 14:25-33 </p>
				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>The Book of Wisdom asks who can know God's counsel, or who can conceive what the Lord intends?  This week he deals with the mystery of God, but in today's Gospel Jesus turns to the crowds to tell us what we must do to be his true followers. They followed him because he fed them and healed them through wonderful miracles. Last week he taught us humility by telling us to be humble to  choose the lowest place at banquets. Man can scarcely guess the things on earth, and our inability to solve today's problems seem to confirm Wisdom's sayings. What we think is within our grasp eludes us. Our problems we can define but cannot solve. The words of Jesus spoken through his Holy Spirit make straight his ways, but few are able to follow them. </p>
				<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
				<p><b>In every age, O Lord, you have been our refuge.</b></p>
				<p>You turn men back into dust,<br/>
				saying, "Return O children of men."<br/>
				For a thousand years in your sight <br/>

				or as a watch in the night. <b>Response</b></p>

				<p>You make an end of them in their sleep;<br/>
				the next morning, they are like the changing grass, which at dawn springs up anew, <br/>
				but by evening withers and fades. <b>Response</b></p>

				<p>Teach us to number our days aright, <br/>
				that we may gain wisdom of heart. Return O Lord! How long? <br/>
				Have pity on your servants. <b>Response</b></p>

				<p>Fill us at daybreak, with your kindness, <br/>
				that we may shout with joy and gladness all our days. <br/>
				And may the gracious care of the Lord our God be ours; <br/>
				prosper the work of our hands for us! <br/>
				Prosper the work of our hands! <b>Response</b></p>

				<h4>Gospel</h4>
				<p>Who would have guessed that God's counsel would have been to hate the relationships of our family and loved ones in order to follow him. Jesus leaves the banquet symbol of the Eucharist and turns to the practical conditions of  Christian living. One who comes to Jesus must hate family relationships enough to leave family loved ones. Otherwise one cannot be a true disciple. Leaving family and loved ones is the cross to be borne. </p>
				<p>Hate is a very strong word in the English language. After all, Jesus asks us to love our neighbor and family are neighbors. Indifferent may be a better word to describe what Jesus intends. Not the indifference of malice but the healthy indifference towards things which allows us the freedom to do always the greater good. Such indifference places God above all else and gives us the unselfish generosity to leave mother and father, brothers and sisters to follow Jesus. It is the charity of the Good Samaritan who cared for the man who fell among robbers and was beaten to near death. </p>
				<p>Called to follow Jesus, one must have the qualities cited above. He must also be a thinking person, otherwise he will appear foolish as the man starting to build a tower he hasn't the resources to complete. People will laugh at him; he could not finish what he started.</p>
				<p>The military conflict image is not simply a question of numbers and strategy. It may involve dying; is one prepared to live with and to die for his king. If not he should negotiate peace terms. Jesus does not relent; the Christian following him is meant to complete what he started and become the person he can be and Jesus intends. That life is a spiritual combat within, "For the corruptible body burdens the soul, and the earthen shelter weighs down the mind, and the deliberations of mortals are timid, and unsure are our plans."</p>

					<h2>Twenty-second Sunday in Ordinary Time</br/>
					September 01, 2013, Year C</h2>

					<p>Sirach 3:17-18, 20, 28-29; Psalm 68:4-5, 6-7, 10-11 <br/>
					Hebrews 12:18-19, 22-24a; Luke 14:1, 7-14 </p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>The wisdom of today's readings asks us to be humble to be against the thinking and practice of our western world. Our technological advances have made us less sensitive to God in our lives and more aggressive in pursuit of material goods. We don't have time to work on ourselves to improve our quality of life -- spiritual and intellectual. Our abundance of goods give us a comfortable existence but a less qualitative life, because we don't have time to read, reflect, pray, and socialize in depth. We cannot become all that we can be. 
					The first reading tells us what to do: Conduct your affairs with humility and you will be loved more that a giver of gifts. 
					Humble yourself the more, the greater you are, and you will find favor with God. 
					What is too sublime for you , seek not. That is, be yourself; don't try to be God.</p>

					<h4>Responsorial Psalm</h4>
					<p>The psalm tells us that God in his goodness has made a home for the poor. We may think that he means the poor of the ghetto or the barrios. He  also means us, the poor creatures of earth who cannot return to the Father in heaven by ourselves. </p>
					
					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
					<p><b>God, in your goodness, you have made a home for the poor.</b></p>
					<p>The just rejoice and exult before God;</br>
					they are glad and rejoice. Sing to God, chant praise to his name; </br>
					whose name is the Lord. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<p>The father of orphans and defender of widows</br>
					is God in his holy dwelling. God gives a home to the forsaken;</br>
					he leads forth prisoners to prosperity. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<p>A bountiful rain you showered down, O God, upon your inheritance; </br>
					you restored the land where it languished; your stock settled in it; </br>
					in your goodness, o God, you provided it for the needy. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>In the Gospel Jesus is more direct and practical. When invited to a wedding or a party, one should not sit in a place of honor. We have solved that dilemma today by having place seating. When giving a party don't invite friends and neighbors but invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, blessed will you be, even though friends may think you silly. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous. Do Christ's words fit the modern world we live in today/ Many would say they do not.</p>
					<p>Good Samaritan</p>
					<p>In another part of scripture Jesus gives us the parable of the good Samaritan. He was a man of means with a pure heart. His actions are outside of friends and neighbors in the local sense. His is the universal kind of help where all mankind are brothers and sisters and each one is neighbor. The good Samaritan will do the greater good because he is aware of God's words. He tended the victim's wounds and placed him on his own beast and took him to an inn. He paid for his care and will pay more if it is needed. The Samaritan knows the world, he knows his fellow man, and he knows himself well and that he is meant to help his fellow citizens. In knowing himself he knows God and what is asked of him. He is 'his own man' and is mature, generous, and responsible; he deals with life and the problems it presents.</p>
					<p>It is through our bodies that we do humble actions -- that's what makes it so difficult. It is the spirit of humility that helps us to act humbly. </p>

					Colossians 2:12-14; Luke 11:1-13</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>By interceding on behalf of Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham fulfilled the three examples of prayer given by Jesus in the Gospel. The good and just God will come down to Sodom and Gomorrah to find out for himself if the situation was as bad as reported.  Abraham wanted to save the cities because they contained his friend and neighbors, Lot and his family. He approached the Lord God and petitioned him to save the cities. Through perseverance and boldness, and some cajoling, he talked the Lord down from fifty to ten men. Abraham 'knocked" he "sought" and he "found," but Sodom and Gomorrah failed him. Ten good men did not live among them.</p>
					
					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
					<p><b>Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.</b></p>
					<p>I will give thanks to you, O Lord, with all my, heart <br/>
					for you have heard the words of my mouth;<br/>
					in the presence of the angels I will sing your praise; I will worship at your holy temple <br/>
					and give thanks to your name. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<p>Because of your kindness and your truth;<br/>
					for you have made great above all things m your name and your promise. When I called you answered me;<br/>
					you built up strength within me. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<p>The Lord is exalted, yet the lowly he sees,<br/>
					and the proud he know from afar. Though I walk amid distress, your preserve me, <br/>
					against the anger of my enemies Eurasia your hand. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<p>Your right hand saves me. <br/>
					The Lord will complete what he has done for me; <br/>
					your kindness, O O Lord, endures forever; <br/>
					forsake not the work of your hands. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>When Jesus had finished praying to the Father, one of his disciples asked him to teach them to pray as John the Baptist had taught his disciples. 
					The avalanche of information on how to pray, what to say, whom to imitate reveals God's great love and merciful concern for all mankind. 
					"Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come."</p>
					
					<p>First, acknowledge God for who he is; he is holy, say so. His kingdom come. Bring his kingdom to earth as only we can. Make it pervade the whole universe as God want through his Son Jesus Christ. </p>
					<p><b>"Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our sins."</b><br/>
					Ask properly for our daily bread. We are meant to earn it by the sweat of our brow, but even with this effort, we should ask God's help. He wants to be involved in giving it to us. It is not ours by right. We have no rights before God, only freedom, duties and obligations because of who he is and what he has given to us. By responding maturely to this we love him freely for his loving generosity of redeeming us from eternal death. </p>

					<p><b>"For we ourselves forgive everyone in debt to us." </b><br/>
					Here Jesus is being really positive on our behalf. For us he forgives everyone in debt to us, but we must try. Do we, ourselves in our frail humanity,  really forgive everyone in debt to us? I do not think so! It's a struggle to forgive others even the little offenses to do against us. For this gift of forgiving love we need to pray to our loving Father for the gift of forgiveness.</p>

					<p><b>"And do not subject us to the final test." </b><br/>
					Really, Lord God, do not, so many of us would undoubtedly fail. If the test is on your loving forgiveness, so many of us would fail. 
					Notice that the man whose friend has come at midnight, is a real friend. He is not afraid to inconvenience his neighbor at such a late hour in order to feed his friend. That friend may have arrived after a long journey, like the journey of life and be in need of real bread. The bedded down neighbor will get up and give the loaves because of friendship, he will do it because of his perseverance. </p>
					<p>"And I tell you," it is Jesus the Son of God speaking, "ask and you will receive, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks, receives, and the one who seeks, finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened." Do we who fail so much in these qualities need any greater encouragement. Jesus himself will do it for us, if we but ask him with sincerity. </p>

					<p>Genesis 18:1--10a; Psalm 15:2-3, 3-4, 5; <br/>
					Colossians 1:24--28; Luke 10:38--42 </p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>The Lord appeared to Abraham who saw his Lord in the Trinitarian form of three men. He ran from the entrance of his tent to greet them and 
					bowing low greeted them. 'Sir, if I may ask you this favor, please do not go past your servant." Abraham wanted to dine with his 
					Lord now that he had come so close to him. The very reason the Lord had come in a vision was to be close to his people. Later the Lord will come 
					even closer in the person of Jesus Christ, and this time the good Lord will give his people his body and blood to eat. The chosen people must see 
					this food through the vision of faith as Abraham had seen it in his form or faith. </p>

					<p>Jesus asked his disciples to do likewise and dine with him. 'Take and eat, this is my body given up for you." The Eucharistic Lord 
					feeds the weary traveler food on his spiritual journey. Jesus who remains with us in the Eucharist nourishes us on our way. Abraham the man of 
					faith did not hesitate to feed his Trinitarian Lord on his way. In nourishing the Lord's physical life, he and his wife in turn received 
					the gift of new life in Sarah's pregnancy. New life from an old man and a barren Sarah was God's gift which prefigures the death 
					and resurrection of Jesus who fulfills the Old Testament by his death and resurrection.</p>

					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
					<p><b>He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.</b></p>

					<p>One who walks blamelessly and does justice; <br/> 
					who thinks the truth in his heart <br/>
					and slanders not with his tongue. <b>Response</b></p>

					<p>Who harms not his fellow man, <br/> 
					nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor; by whom the reprobate is despised, <br/> 
					while he honors those who fear the Lord. <b>Response</b></p>

					<p>Who lends not his money at usury <br/>
					and accepts no bribe against the innocent. One who does these things <br/>
					shall never be disturbed. <b>Response</b></p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>

					<p>Jesus was a friend of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus. He came to their village and Martha welcomed him and began to prepare a meal for them. 
					Mary sat at the feet of Jesus and listened to his words. 'Martha, burdened with much serving, came to him and said, 'Lord, do you not care that 
					my sister has left me by myself to do the serving? Tell her to help me." Jesus pointed out to Martha that she was anxious over 
					many things and that Mary had chosen the better part. </p>
					<p>What was the better part in the first reading now seems to be the lesser part in the Gospel. Contemplative Mary has chosen the better part. 
					Are Martha's preparations a waste of time? Of course not. She is the hostess, and had welcomed Jesus to stay and dine with them. 
					Martha's work is important and Jesus knew that, but she had deflected the attention from Jesus, the guest, on to herself. 
					Mary, on the other hand, was listening to Jesus the Bridegroom who would be with them for only a short time. Both roles are important, 
					but Martha lost focus by thinking of herself -- not an uncommon weakness. Mary gave her full attention to Jesus and her contemplation will 
					not be taken away from her. In order to give ourselves over to Jesus completely, we must first listen deeply to his words and follow them 
					ardently without distraction. </p>

					<p>Deuteronomy 30:10-14; Psalm 69:14, 17, 30-31, 33, 34, 36, 37 <br/>
					Colossians 1:15-20; Luke 10:25-37</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>All today's readings tell us to obey God's words , tell us how, and tell us why.<br/>
					'Moses said to the people, 'if only you would heed the voice of the Lord, your God, and keep his commandments and statutes, 
					that are written in the book of the law, when you return to the Lord, your God, with all your heart and all your soul."<BR>
					Look outside of yourself at God's commandments given to Moses on the mountain. They are meant to be seen and learned by heart from the 
					great prophet who received them from a conversation with God. Once we become conscious of God's words we have internalized them and are 
					meant to keep them. Of course, our freedom is involved here; we can accept or reject God's commands. How many of us have really thought 
					in our enthusiasm for freedom, that, that same freedom can take us to hell? That is, away from God and his love and glory. God's contact 
					with Moses and God's commands are to show us through our senses that the God of Israel is real. He lives, he talks, he communicates, 
					he has power and gives commands to those he favors and reveals himself to. This word of God is not in the sky or across the sea for someone to 
					seek and bring back to us. It is close, once conscious of it, it remains in our hearts and on our lips; we have only to carry it out. Make it real, 
					to exist, by our actions and pronouncements, and God becomes more real in our world. </p>

					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>

					<p><b>Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.</b></p>
					<p>I pray to you, O Lord, <br/>
					for the time of your favor. O God! In your great kindness answer me <br/> 
					with your constant help. Answer me, O Lord, for bounteous is your kindness; <br/>
					in your great mercy turn toward me. <b>Response</b></p>

					<p>I am afflicted and in pain, <br/>
					let your saving help, O God, protect me. I will praise the name of God in song, <br/>
					and I will glorify him with thanksgiving. <b>Response</b></p>

					<p>See, you lowly ones and be glad; <br/>
					you who seek God, may your hearts revive! For the Lord hears the poor, <br/>
					and his own who are in bonds he spurns not." <b>Response</b></p>

					<p>For God will save Zion <br/>
					and rebuild the cities of Judah. The descendants of his servants shall inherit it, <br/>
					and those who love his name shall inhabit it. <b>Response</b></p>

					<h4>Second Reading from the St. Paul's letter to the Colossians</h4>

					<p>In the second reading Saint Paul gives us <i>reasons</i> why we ought to believe in Jesus Christ the Son of God. He is the image of the 
					invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.<br/>
					For in him were created all things in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible. <br/>
					He is before all things, and in him all things hold together, (that is exist). </p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>

					<p>A scholar of the law thought that he would test Jesus with the question, 'Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" 
					Jesus responded, 'What is written in the law? how do you read it?" The man answered correctly and Jesus approved his response, 
					"Do this and you will live." The scholar wanted to test Jesus further by asking who is his neighbor. The Gospel text in Luke 
					gives Jesus an opportunity to educate the scholar and us. He does this by giving us the parable of the Good Samaritan. In it Jesus moves from 
					the world of the spiritual to the world of the physical, from theory to practice. The good neighbor is the one who shows mercy to the victim 
					of the robbers. The scholar answered correctly of this also, so Jesus told him to, 'Go and do likewise." The good neighbor performs 
					good works.</p>

					<h4>Reflection</h4>
					<p>Let us love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our being, with all our strength, with all our mind, and love of our neighbor 
					will follow.</p>

					<h2>Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ<br/>
					June 02, 2013, Year C</h2>

					<p>Genesis 14:18-20; Psalm 110:1, 2, 3, 4 <br/>
					One Corinthians 11:23-26; Luke 9:11b-17</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>In today's first reading the traditional king of Salem, Melchizedek, blessed Abraham by God. He then blessed God who had delivered Abraham 
					from the hands of his foes. Abraham gave Melchizedek one tenth of his booty, part of his due as king of Salem. This meeting was an introduction 
					of our father in faith to Jerusalem which later became the spiritual center of Israel. Jerusalem would later become the city of king David who 
					had saved his people from their enemies. Later still, Jesus Christ will save Jerusalem and the world from their spiritual enemies. In doing so 
					Jesus reveals himself as king of heaven and earth residing in the heavenly Jerusalem.</p>

					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>

					<p><b>You are a priest forever in the line of Melchizedek.</b></p>
					<p>The Lord said to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand <br/>
					and I will make your enemies your footstool." <br/>
					The scepter of your power the Lord will stretch forth from Zion. <br/>
					'Rule in the midst of your enemies." <b>Response</b></p>

					<p>"Yours is princely power in the day of your birth, in holy splendor; <br/>
					before the daystar, like the dew, I have begotten you." <b>Response</b></p>

					<p>The Lord has sworn, and he will not repent:<br/>
					"You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek." <b>Response</b></p>

					<h4>Second Reading</h4>

					<p>In this passage from St. Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, he teaches his converts what he had received from Jesus Christ, Faith. This gift is intended for all who are free to receive it and who 
					desire to be saved. <br/>
					For the Jews memory is a living entity; Joseph insisted that his bones return to Israel with his community. For Jesus to speak and remember 
					his suffering and death on the cross is to make it real. On the night before he died, he said to his disciples; 'This is my body that is for you. 
					Do this in memory of me." In the same way also the cup, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as often as you drink 
					it, in remembrance of me." For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes.</p>

					<h4>Living Memory Today</h4>

					<p>How do we understand living memory today, what are its signs, its reality. I suggest to you that it is contained in the trauma of our times 
					as Christ's was contained in his times. The signs were first noticed after W.W.I when troops returned home 'shell shocked." They were 
					different from the men who left wives and loved ones to fight the war. The same phenomenon happened after W.W.II, Korea, and Vietnam. These 
					men and were traumatized and carried in their enlivened mind and imagination the horrors of war. In the safety of their homes they were reliving 
					the memories of war. Traumatic conditions spread into the cultural and social arena in the form of domestic violence, abortion, the sex trade, 
					abuse of all sorts, drugs. Now one need not go to war to suffer from PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder); it can be had on the home front. 
					The garden variety of such trauma is contained in 'the family baggage." Too many people in the world today have these kinds of living 
					traumatic memories. God, it seems to me, has allowed us to arrive at this point of development so as to understand the meaning of 'living memory." 
					Those who suffer these conditions have traumatic memories as their constant companions and will confirm that they are living. 
					They are meant to lead us back to God the Father as his sufferings led Jesus home to the Father.</p>

					<p>Do this in memory of me, brothers and sisters, may eventually come to mean do this in memory of us, but we have yet to pass in death. For the 
					present, as members of Christ's Mystical Body on earth we participate in his active memory of dying and rising until he comes again.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Jesus spoke to the crowds about the kingdom of God, and he healed those who needed to be cured -- actions by a man of princely power and 
					might who knew what he was about. As the day drew to a close the apostles asked Jesus to dismiss the crowds that they might find something to 
					eat at the nearby villages. Words of apostles with no princely power or might. Jesus had told them to give the crowd some food themselves. 
					They were unable to do so as they did not have money to buy enough food for the crowd. A boy in the crowd had five loaves and a couple of fish. 
					Jesus took them and looking up to heaven he said the blessing, broke them and gave them to the disciples to distribute to the crowds. This action 
					bears a remarkable resemblance to that of Abraham before Melchizedek. Abraham acknowledged Melchizedek and received God's blessing. Jesus 
					acknowledged the power of God and the crowd were fed. Jesus will pay our tithes to God for us later.</p>

					<h4>Reflection</h4>

					<p>The living memory of Jesus in the Eucharist keeps us alive today without our permission. We are meant to befriend him in our living memory 
					on earth that we may live with him consciously and knowingly in eternity.</p>

					<h2>Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity<br/>
					May 26, 2013, Year C</h2>

					<p>Proverbs 8:22-31; Psalm 8:4-5, 6-7, 8-9 <br/>
					Romans 5:1-5; John 16:12-15</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>In today's first reading Wisdom assures us that God possessed him from the beginning. The forerunner of God's prodigies he was before earth. 
					He was brought forth, "begotten" before all else, even the heavens. Wisdom was beside God as his craftsman, and was God's delight playing on 
					earth's surface, and he found delight in the human race. And all of this before and during creation. This is the spirit of God who enjoys 
					playing on earth among men.</p>

					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>

					<p><b>O Lord, our God, how wonderful your name in all the earth.</b></p>

					<p>When I behold the heavens, the work of your fingers, <br/>
					the moon and the stars which you set in place <br/>
					what is man that you should be mindful of him, <br/>
					or the son of man that you should care for him? <b>Response</b></p>

					<p>You have made him little less than the angels,<br/> 
					and crowned him with glory and honor. <br/>
					You have given him rule over the works of your hands, <br/> 
					putting all things under his feet: <b>Response</b></p>

					<p>All sheep and oxen, <br/>
					yes, and the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, the fish of the sea, <br/> 
					and whatever swims the paths of the seas. <b>Response</b></p>

					<h4>Second Reading</h4>
					<p>St. Paul's letter to the Romans tells us that hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been 
					given to us. </p>
					<h4>Gospel John 16:12-15 </h4>
					<p>Today's Gospel from John is a brief resume of Jesus' farewell discourse dealt with in chapters fourteen and sixteen. It combines the teaching 
					of the Father for the disciples of Jesus, to keep the word of God as preached by Jesus and enlightened by the Holy Spirit. Jesus has many things 
					to tell his disciples but they cannot hear them. </p>

					<p>The gruesome details of Jesus' passion, death are too much for them to support, and his glorious resurrection is too incredible for them to 
					understand without seeing him alive. They are not mature enough psychologically and spiritually to withstand events which they cannot conceive.
					However, when the Spirit of truth comes he will lead you to the complete truth, since he will not be speaking of his own accord, but will 
					say only what he has been told; and he will reveal to you the things to come. <br/>
					"He will glorify me, since all he reveals to you will be taken from what is mine. <br/>
					Everything the Father has is mine; that is why I said: all he reveals to you will be taken from what is mine."<br/>
					Jesus is teaching them what they need to know before he leaves earth. <br/>
					The lesson is that they must keep the Father's word in order to gain eternal life.<br/>
					The Father's word and that of Jesus are the same, for Jesus is the Word of God Incarnate. <br/>
					The Holy Spirit who has been with the Father from the beginning will enlighten the disciples. <br/>
					Jesus is passing on this knowledge of God to his disciples through the role of the persons in the Holy Trinity. <br/>
					As human beings they must receive it in faith by keeping the words of Jesus and the Father. The Holy Spirit's role is to enlighten us as he 
					is the Spirit of the Father and the Son and knows them intimately as Spirit. Christ's followers are meant to imitate the Trinitarian relationship 
					by loving God, self, and neighbor through a community enlivened by God's Holy Spirit. <br/>
					As the Father sent Jesus on a mission to earth to reveal him, So Jesus and the Father send the Holy Spirit on mission to enlighten and guide his 
					followers.<br/>
					The mission of Christ's followers is contained in their unity as members of the Church. <br/>
					The Church is missioned to the whole world to reveal the words of Jesus and the Father.</p>

					<h4>Reflection</h4>
					<p>God's possessed wisdom becomes man in Jesus Christ, and his love is poured out in the love of the Holy Spirit. God gives us Jesus to talk 
					with and the Holy Spirit to enlighten us. the Trinity to dwell within</p>
