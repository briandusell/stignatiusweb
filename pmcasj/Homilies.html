						<h2>Sixth Sunday of Easter</h2>
						<h3>May 25, 2014, Year A</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Acts of the Apostles 8:5-8, 14-17; Psalm 66:1-3, 4- 5, 6-7, 16, 20<br/>
					First Letter of Peter 3:15-18; John 14:15-21</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>After his resurrection Jesus greeted his apostles with : "Peace be with you. Whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven them, and whose sins you shall retain they are retained."  The effects of Christ's resurrection was the blossoming of his young Church.. We see the manifestation of the Holy Spirit in today's first reading: "Many possessed and many paralyzed and crippled were cured.  The fruits of these healings are, Joy, Peace, Love, Faith Trust. Jesus repeats, again and again, in his farewell discourse that deep and intimate love He and the Father share. Today's Gospel commentary reveals their profound love in the Holy Spirit.</p>
					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
					<p><b>Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.</b></p>
					<p>Shout joyfully to God all the earth,<br/>
					sing praise to the glory of his name;<br/>
					proclaim his glorious praise.<br/>
					Say to God, "How tremendous are your deeds! <b>Response</b></p>
					<p>Let all the earth worship and sing praise to you,<br/>
					sing praise to your name" <br/>
					Come and see the works of the God,<br/>
					his tremendous deeds among the children of Adam. <b>Response</b></p>
					<p>He has changed the sea into dry land;<br/>
					through the river they passed on foot; <br/>
					therefore let us rejoice in him,<br/>
					He rules by his might forever. <b>Response</b></p>
					<p>Hear now, all you who fear God, <br/>
					while I declare	what he has done for me.<br/> 
					Blessed be God who refuses me not<br/> 
					my prayer or his kindness. <b>Response</b></p>
					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Jesus said  to his disciples:</p>

					<p>"If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
					And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate to be with you always,
					the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot accept,
					because it neither sees nor knows him.
					But you know him, because he remains with you,
					and will be in you.</p>

					<p>I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.
					In a little while the world will no longer see me,
					but you will see me, because I live and you will live.
					On that day you will realize that I am in my Father
					and you are in me and I in you.</p>

					<p>Whoever has my commandments and observes them
					is the one who loves me.
					And whoever loves me will be loved by my Father,
					and I will love him and reveal myself to him."</p>
					<p>This Gospel section is divided into three parts; the logical connection between the first and third parts centers on the clause:
					"If you love me, you will keep my commandments",
					"Whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who loves me".  </p>
					<p>What triggers the middle statement, in which Jesus says he will not leave 'you orphans', is the insistence that the gift of the Spirit does not mean the absence of Jesus; Jesus's love will not allow that.  We can say that now, though Jesus ascends to the Father, believers are nearer than ever to living with the Triune God: Father, Son and Spirit.  This degree of intimacy with the Trinity was never recognized in the OT; as John had said in his first chapter, "From his fullness we have all received, grace in place of grace,because while the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."  Our awareness of the divine self-immersion into the world has increased far beyond the understanding recognized in the OT.</p>
					<p>The words of our Gospel are part of the 4-chapter farewell speech of Jesus to his disciples at the Last Supper; contextually they are, as mentioned earlier, part of that which one would say to one's dearest before one can speak no more.</p>
					<p>There is a clear emphasis on obedience to 'my commandments'.  Such obedience is done because one loves Jesus - as expressed here, obedience does not precede love - and one is identified as one who loves Jesus by one's doing what Jesus has asked.  Obedience is the expression of love.  Interestingly, it is difficult to find in the Gospel what the commandments of Jesus are; John seems more concerned to define Jesus than to specify his commandments.  This factor   supports the understanding that the Evangelists presume quite a bit from their audiences - here, the individual moral commands are presumed; the Gospels have no intention to communicate everything about Jesus, but depend on the lengthy tradition that has preceded the Gospel writings and indeed help form the Gospels themselves.</p>
					<p>Though John writes precisely because of the perceived newness of God's self-revelation, he insists on the age-old tie between love and obedience, terms most visible in the Covenant religion of Israel and Yahweh.  As with the Covenant, the union between God and believer emphasizes God's love with His covenant partner.  Obedience was always the requirement to keep the Covenant unbroken.  We know the Covenant was broken often, and this thought leads to the conclusion/caveat that, though the Covenant might be destroyed, God's love is not, and it will search again and again to renew the Covenant.  Jesus draws conclusions further: he is the Son of the Father (assumed by the Gospel as believed in by its readers), and assures his disciples of his own love, which then results in his self-revelation.  Presumably, though there are reported visions and appearances later in Tradition, Jesus means to underline here a work of the Holy Spirit who, not so much interested in an 'appearance', is interested in the meaning or revelation of the Son that the appearance means to communicate.</p>
					<p>[It is only fair to say that, if one note there are no moral commands recorded in John's Gospel (as in Matthew or Luke), John does have the foundational command from Jesus: "Love one another as I have loved you".]</p>

						<h2>Fifth Sunday of Easter<h2>
						<h3>May 18, 2014, Year A</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Acts of the Apostles 6:1-7; Psalm 33:1-2, 4-5, 18-19<br/>
					First Letter of Peter 2:4-9; John 14:1-12</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>As the number of disciples in Jerusalem grew it became clear that change was needed. The Lord was truly calling many to follow in his footsteps, but a multi-lingual community will experience difficulties.. The Hellenists complained to the Hebrews that their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food. The disciples called the community together and told them to, "select from among you seven reputable men filled with the Spirit and wisdom whom we shall appoint to the task." They presented these seven to the apostles who prayed and laid hands on them. Stephen the first martyr was one of them, and soon afterwards the Father called him to Himself.</p>
					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
					<p><b>Lord let your mercy be on us, as we place our trust in you.</b></p> 
					<p>Exult, you just, in the Lord;<br/> 
					praise from the upright is fitting.<br/> 
					Give thanks to the Lord on the harp;<br/> 
					with the ten-stringed lyre chant his praises. <b>Response</b></p>
					<p>See, the eyes of the Lord are upon those who fear him,<br/>
					upon those who hope for his kindness, <br/>
					To deliver them from death<br/>
					and preserve them in spite of famine. <b>Response</b></p>
					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>These verses are part of the lengthy discourse (mostly a monologue, at times a dialogue) that occupies center-stage at Jesus' Last Supper.  And whenever the Last Supper is considered, we must keep in mind that these words of Jesus are his last to very close and dear friends and companions before he has no more opportunity to speak to them ever again. </p> 
					<p>Before our Sunday Gospel begins, Jesus has said that he is going where no one of his friends can follow.  Such a statement deserves the first line of today's Gospel reading: 'do not let your hearts be troubled' at my departure.  Jesus calls for faith in himself, which here means to emphasize, first, they believe that his leaving means he will imaginatively 'prepare dwelling places' for his friends, and, secondly, that they believe that he will return to take them to live once more with himself.
					A second paragraph now follows without a tight logical connection to the first lines we have considered.  In this new paragraph, Jesus reveals himself to be the way and the truth and the life.  (Many scholars think this statement should be understood to mean: 'I am the way that leads to the truth that will provide you with life [eternal]'.)  Remaining for the moment within the contextual image of 'journeying' ('I am going to my Father's house.'), Jesus speaks of himself as the 'way' - a term which at least means that 'no one comes to the Father except through me'.  [To speak of 'the way' reminds one that the community of earliest disciples of Jesus, after Pentecost, was known as 'the Way'; the title 'Christian' was applied to them later, and remains.]  Jesus's being the 'way' underlines the commitment one makes in baptism, wherein the baptized promises God and oneself to follow Christ, walk as he walked, to choose as he would choose, to love as he loves.  Jesus is truth in that the full reality about life is found only in him; apart from him one has at best only partial truth about life's meaning.  That Jesus is the life means that only by embracing him will one have the fullness of life, of happiness, of fulfillment which we have some taste of here on earth.  I should not deny that John may also be using the words of Jesus to underline the mystical union of Jesus and the believer, wherein the believer's life is actually the life of Jesus - as, in the manner John notes elsewhere, the life of a branch is really only the life of the vine into which the branch is inserted.</p>
					<p>The third paragraph of this Gospel section means to underline the oneness of the Father and Jesus.  If one understands Jesus correctly, one sees not just Jesus, but the Father.  Jesus laments that Philip has not understood that association with Jesus is to know that the Father is in Jesus and so is visible.  This fatherly presence is known by two experiences (already noted earlier in the Gospel): first, by Jesus' words are the words of the Father, for Jesus can only say what the Father gives him to say, and, second, by Jesus' works, which are divine works, i.e. works identified as typical of the Father.  To Jesus, such words and works can only mean that Jesus is in the Father and the Father is in Jesus.  Such is Jesus' self-understanding that he cannot say that the Father only 'works through' him.  Jesus is not simply a prophet or holy man; his words and works indicate a relationship to the Father that can only be called a mystery and cannot be fully explained by human reason. 
					Finally, again without tight logic with what precedes, Jesus assures his disciples that the believer will do the works Jesus does, and even greater works.  Works of Jesus are attested in the miracles of  the Gospels, and disciples in Acts and beyond  will, through the name of Jesus, work similar miracles.   A 'greater work' is the future witness of the disciples which leads to baptism, i.e. to new life, and the continued presence of the Spirit in all believers, visibly in the gifts of the Spirit; Jesus did not do such 'great works' during his public life.</p>
					<p>Let me underline two constant elements of Jesus' speech in this Gospel section.  First, so much of his words follow, he notes, only if one believes; faith is both a consistent profession that Jesus is Son of God, the Word-made-flesh, and an unwavering trust in the word of this Son of God.  Faith is crucial, professing to know what human mind could never know clearly on his own; one must proceed further that human reasoning to begin to understand what Jesus is speaking about.  And this knowledge becomes the basis on which one makes all moral choices.  Apparently, the disciples do not have this degree of faith as yet.  Second, there is no talk of God here; there is only talk of 'the Father'.  'The Father' means to emphasize the source of Jesus (Jesus is in the beginning of the Gospel at first the Word of God, but soon and forever called Son of the Father), and to explain the sharing of thought, word and works, as one might find, in a weaker sense, in the image of a human father and son sharing in each other. For John, the best understanding of God is as Father; this explains his mind and heart and the love that exists between God and Jesus, the love of father and son totally devoted to each other.</p>  
					<p>One can appreciate why Jesus wanted to speak to his disciples before he was silenced: he loved them now, at this dinner, wanted them to know the truth, if only they believed.  But as our Gospel reading emphasizes, Jesus points to a future for his disciples; he personally will prepare their eternal dwellings for them, and he will return for them, so that they all will be together again, once death has had its loud, but passing, temporary say.  Jesus enlivens; death destroys, and Jesus makes sure his disciples live forever with him.</p>

						<h2>Fourth Sunday of Easter</h2>
						<h3>May 11, 2014, Year A</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Acts of the Apostles 2:14a, 36-41; Psalm 23:1-3a, 3b-4, 5, 6 <br/> 
					First Letter of Peter 2:20b-25; John 10:1-10</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Peter stood up and preached loudly to all in Israel that God had made both Lord and Christ, Jesus whom they had crucified. Many who heard asked, "What are we to do, now that we know Jesus has been raised from the dead?" Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of their sins, and they will receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
					<p>Implicit in entering by the narrow gate Jesus talks of in the Gospel are: Listening to God's call. Repentance for sins, Baptism in Jesus' name, acceptance of the Holy Spirit, and witnessing to Christ crucified and risen. </p>
					<p>Jesus himself is the Gate, but he also had to make several passages in order to return to his Father. He obeyed the Father's plan to save the world. He took upon himself human flesh from Mary his mother. His humanity allowed him to suffer like other humans only more intensely. He passed through death as a common criminal. Then he rose to glory as the risen Lord and Savior of the world.</p>
					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
					<p><b>The Lord is my shepherd, there is nothing I shall want.</b></p>
					<p>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.<br/> 
					In verdant pastures he gives me repose;<br/>
					beside restful waters he leads me;<br/> 
					he refreshes my soul. <b>Response</b></p>
					<p>He guides me in right paths for his name's sake.<br/> 
					Even though I walk in the dark valley I fear no evil; <br/>
					for you are at my side with your rod and your staff <br/>
					that give me courage. <b>Response</b></p>
					<p>You spread the table before me <br/>
					in the sight of my foes; <br/>
					you anoint my head with oil; <br/>
					my cup overflows. <b>Response</b></p>
					<p>Only goodness and kindness follow me <br/>
					all the days of my life;<br/> 
					and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord<br/> 
					for years to come. <b>Response</b></p>
					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>For centuries, one of the most popular images the OT uses to present the relationship between God and Israel was that of Shepherd and sheep.   This was an informative, but also affective image which touched the daily experiences of many in Israel's centuries, for many, even in the time of Jesus's Galilee, practiced shepherding.  While occasionally famous OT passages are used to make clear God's anger which rid His people of false or bad shepherds, very often the image is quite positive, expressing both the sacrifices God makes as shepherd and the longing of Israel for its Shepherd and his divine pastures.  The OT does not hesitate to apply to God the tenderness towards His people that one often found in the fields of Galilee, Samaria and Judaea, and to Israel the fidelity of the sheep who know the source of their blessedness and follow so willingly.  In our Gospel reading today, Jesus uses two aspects of this traditional relationship between shepherd and sheep.  First, he describes himself as the rightful one to enter the sheepfold, to lead the sheep, to walk ahead of them, with them able to recognize his voice; all of this serves the truth that this shepherd, who loves his sheep and whose sheep know and follow him, will lead his sheep to the finest pastures, those pastures for which the sheep long while in their pen.</p>
					<p>This first image of this Gospel is that of rightful shepherd, who knows his sheep intimately and who is followed with trust.  But Jesus's reference to himself as the true shepherd has a purpose.  In his experience, other teachers have tried to lead these same sheep; they are false shepherds because they do not teach the truth, i.e. all the teaching that is the will of God and guide so that Israel be able to enter and enjoy the divine pastures.  When Jesus speaks of those who have gone before in misleading Israel, he refers not to the ancient prophets, but to the long tradition of interpretation of God's will, rooted in the errors taught by many Pharisees, Scribes and still others, of earlier decades and in Jesus' own time.  The Gospel testifies to the fact that Jesus' audiences had more trust in his teachings than in the teachings of other 'authorities'.  (To be fair, we must say that Jesus and other authorities of the time agreed on certain understandings of God's will, but it is also fair to say that their differences were notable, and led to Jesus's death.)  It is not explained why, but it is affirmed that the sheep, those in covenant with God, recognize the truth when they hear it and longingly follow it (similarly, it is difficult to explain the reality that sheep know the voice of the shepherd).  We can rightly see in John's presentation a reference to the bitter struggle between Jesus and other teachers: the question is nothing less than who knows what will lead to a human being's eternal happiness.</p>
					<p>The second image Jesus offers is not now of 'shepherd', but of 'gate', specifically that gate through which the sheep can reach pastures.  To picture Jesus as the 'gate' is not easy, yet points up a significant element of the Gospel.  The image means to emphasize that the way to the pastures of satisfaction is faith in Jesus (which is the meaning of his being the gate or means to pasture), to be formalized by Baptism, which allows the Spirit of God to dwell in the believer.  God can come no closer than to become human and then to take up life within the believer.  Such is the closeness God intends to have with His creature, if the creature will walk through that gate which alone can lead to complete happiness. </p>  
					<p>The wonderfulness of the pasture is expressed in the most glorious term John can think to use: life.  He will say at the (original) end of his Gospel that his entire effort to tell the story of Jesus had as its purpose 'to show that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through this belief you may have life in his name '.  One might prefer other terms to describe the eternal happiness towards which all beings are created to reach, but John prefers 'Life', and one cannot argue too much against his choice: the perfect life, or life in its perfection, is the aspiration of all living beings who sense the lack of this kind of life in the life they do now have and want perfect and forever.  For John this longing means that one find the One who can lead to life, the Shepherd, whose voice the sheep know and follow with trust, and the Gate, through which the sheep pass to enjoy the eternal pastures.</p>

						<h2>Third Sunday of Easter</h2>
						<h3>May 04, 2014, Year A</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Acts of the Apostles 2:14, 22-33; Psalm 16:1-2, 5, 7-8, 9-10, 11<br/> 
					First Letter of Peter 1:17-21; Luke 24:13-25</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>In today's first reading from The Acts of the Apostles the evangelist Luke has Peter giving a brief review of Jesus' public life and passion. Peter exhorts the Jews who put Jesus to death and all others to listen, and pay heed,  to his account of Jesus' death and resurrection. He recalled for them what God had promised to David, "that he would set one of his descendants upon his throne. Exalted at the right hand of God, he received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, and poured him fourth as you see and hear." In today's Gospel reading Jesus consoled two disciples returning home discouraged at the apparent failure of his mission and promise to free Israel. By explaining his role in the Jewish Scriptures through a personal re-revelation, he opens their eyes and lifts their spirits. After encouraging him to stay with them, their eyes were opened at his breaking of the bread; they realized he was Jesus, he is alive and they believed.</p>
					
					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>
					<p><b>Lord you will show us the path to life.</b></p>
					
					<p>Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge;<br/> 
					I say to the Lord, "My Lord are you." <br/>
					O Lord, my allotted portion and my cup, <br/>
					you it is who hold fast my lot. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<p>I bless the Lord who counsels me; <br/>
					even in the night my heart exhorts me.<br/> 
					I set the Lord ever before me:<br/> 
					with him at my right hand I shall never be disturbed. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<p>Therefore my heart is glad and my soul rejoices,<br/>
					my body, too, abides in confidence; <br/>
					because you will not abandon my soul to the netherworld, <br/>
					nor will you suffer your faithful one to undergo corruption. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<p>You will show me the path to life,<br/>
					abounding joy in your presence,<br/> 
					the delight at your right hand forever. <b>Response</b></p>
					
					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Emmaus means 'warm spring', referring to valuable waters issuing there.  There is some disagreement as to the location of Emmaus; our Gospel follows those who say it is 7 miles (NE) from Jerusalem.  Luke is clear that the event he now narrates happened on the day of resurrection, 'the first day of the week', i.e. the day after the Sabbath; it is Luke's second resurrection story, all of them occurring on the resurrection day itself.  Acts says that Jesus continued to teach after his resurrection; here he teaches a very valuable lesson.  What the conversation of these two disciples was will become clear.  Jesus joins these two disciples (one named Cleopas or Clopas, the other unnamed [perhaps his wife?]). 
					Many think that Luke is using a device here, often seen in plays and operas, where the identity of someone is artificially kept from the eyes of the major players till the moment of revelation. </p>
					<p>Jesus's question about the subject of the heated discussion of these two disciples of Jesus, leads to Cleopas' extremely accurate miniature of the entire Gospel; and it comes from a disciple who, for lack of belief in the resurrection of Jesus, now in discouragement turns homeward; all the promise of Jesus to free Israel has been dashed by his ugly death.  Jesus, to these disciples, was to be bunched with the many others who promised freedom - and failed to deliver it. </p>
					<p>Now for the first of Luke's teachings.   All the Scriptures, which were the best and inerrant witnesses to the intentions and will of God, spoke of the events experienced in these past days and months: this includes not only the power and wisdom of Jesus, but also his unjust death and glorious resurrection.  How could Jews not understand these absolutely sure documents, the main author of which is God Himself? 
					The second of Luke's teaching now comes into play.  The disciples, though finally illuminated as to the meaning of their Jewish Scriptures, do not know it is Jesus who is present and is teaching them.  Prevailing on Jesus to stop with them (presumably at Emmaus), they enjoy a sharing of bread, overseen and conducted by Jesus.  The one who usually breaks and distributes food at dinner is a father or one of equal dignity; here Jesus takes the lead.   And indeed, with this sharing of the bread, the disciples now recognize that with them is Jesus - he is both alive and with them.  Remarkable!  And after receiving the bread, they offer their remark: now all is clear to us! </p>
					<p>Two great teachings are involved in this story.  1. Luke has offered an excellent example of the value of reading and understanding the Scriptures and 2. Luke has shown that Jesus is recognized as alive and present through the breaking of the bread in community.  It seems clear, then, that Luke, while wanting to tell a story of Jesus' appearance as risen, has so structured his story as to make it into the basis for every Eucharist which is celebrated by the Christian believers: they hear what God has to say, then enjoy the presence of the risen Jesus.  It is most clever of Luke to organize a past event so that it has meaning for his audience some 50 years after the event.  Finally, these two disciples, obviously new to us (they are never mentioned in the Gospel till now), return enthused with the knowledge that Jesus is indeed the Messiah - only to find that "he has already appeared to Simon Peter".  Again, it is clear that by 80AD the figure of Peter has become central, a figure around which the disciples gather; his significance for Christian communities only grows, despite his early ignorance and denials.  We should note that the appearance of Cleopas and his companion as disciples of Jesus leads to the realization that the followers of Jesus numbered many more than the Twelve and the women Luke notes who followed Jesus.  Indeed, Acts speaks of 120 disciples, a number which far exceeds what we had hitherto known in the Gospel, such as the Twelve, Jesus' family, and the 70 Luke tells us who Jesus sent out on a mission while he was in Galilee.  Who were the unnamed followers?  We just do not know.  We have learned, however, that those discouraged by the crucifixion, recovered their faith through the reading of the Scriptures as they should be read, and by enjoying the presence, even if brief, of the risen Jesus.  What was despair is now only hope.  Indeed, the Eucharist - the reading and the bread - keeps this hope, based on the certainty of Jesus's resurrection, alive for all generations.</p>

						<h2>Second Sunday of Easter - Divine Mercy Sunday</h2>
						<h3>April 27, 2014, Year A</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Acts of the Apostles 2:42-47; Psalm 118: 2-4, 13-15, 23-24 <br/>
					First Letter of Peter 1:3-9; John 20:19-31</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's reading from the Acts of the Apostles describes the life of a spiritually developed Christian community and contrasts with the fearful and confused disciples of today's Gospel. Many signs and wonders worked through the apostles filled the community with awe. These believers held all things in common. prayed as one in the temple area and broke bread together. This active and confident believing community is unmistakably the work of God's Holy Spirit in the Risen Jesus.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>The first day of the week was, for Jews, Sunday; Saturday was the final day of the week, the day of rest, for God and man.  The locked doors points up both the disciples' fear of Jesus's (and so their) enemies and the uniqueness of the body Jesus has for this appearance.  Jesus's wish for peace can be seen as a usual and daily greeting of the time, here has a more precious meaning, that is to console and to strengthen the disciples so fearful at this moment of the Jews (= those Jews who had a hand in bringing about Jesus' death).  When peace is used in the meeting of the divine and the human (here, Jesus and the apostles), there is always a sense of the love of God, a love which anticipates and desires a re-establishment of the Covenant of God with His people.  Thus, Christ's peace for his disciples is a peace which is the result of God's love.  That Jesus shows his hands and side is a veiled Christian attempt to argue the truth that Jesus who rose from the dead is the Jesus so recently crucified; moreover these physical wounds show that Jesus is not just a risen soul.  However, it is true that the body of the risen Jesus was one to fit the circumstance here; what that body would be in heaven is another matter, indeed quite inexplicable.  Joy flows from the realization that Jesus is alive and glorious; the disciples' joy is also an apologetic meant to defend belief in the resurrection of Jesus - people could rejoice because they actually SAW him.  Peace establishes the context in which the sending of the disciples is made possible, even likely.  Here we now are dealing with another belief of the Christian church, namely that its life, especially its witness to the world, is not a private choice, but is a command from God Himself.  Jesus was sent to bring life to the world, as John sees it, and so the Christian witnesses will in their turn help bring the world to life.  Moreover, the apostles, now mandated witnesses to Jesus, receive the Holy Spirit (an act that occurs for Luke some 50 days after the day of Jesus' resurrection).  Spirit is a word meaning 'breath of life'; God breathed into dirt and so Adam came alive.  That same breathing of life now enlivens the disciples.  Indeed, for OT and NT thinking, the Spirit is the life of God, which God will share in various degrees with those in covenant with Him; Christians live by God's life.  One of the results of this sharing in God's life is the fulfillment of God's loving desire that all sins be forgiven; these disciples, who are to witness to the world, will be the instruments of this forgiveness.  [Matthew's Gospel prefers to have Jesus confer this privilege during Jesus' public life; John prefers to have the risen Jesus do it.]  Note that the 'forgiveness' statement does not describe individual sins; it is interested in conveying these three things: identifying who will forgive sins, claiming that those who forgive sins can also retain them, the unity between the apostles and God - God respects the acts of forgiveness (and retention) offered by Himself through the apostles. Finally, we can say that John's verses here, while presenting the salient points in a meeting of the risen Jesus and his disciples, mean to explain the origins of the practices of the church of his time; the Christian church was insistent that its entire history is owed to the influence of God's life breath, and that the apostles were true witnesses and functionaries of the divine will to save all people.   Thus, while there are historical recollections represented in these verses, their main point is the justification of how the Johannine Church of 90's AD defines itself and its mission, so many years after the public life of Jesus.</p>
					<p>Finally, significant for John (consider the number of verses he dedicates to this particular story) is the momentous, final statement of Thomas, one of the Twelve.  For an unexplained reason, Thomas was absent when Jesus presented himself to his Apostles as risen from the dead. (Apparently, Thomas' absence would not keep him from receiving Jesus' breathing the Spirit and the gift of forgiving sins.)  What is important about Thomas's story is his ultimate remark, a remark on which the Gospel originally was meant to close.  (Chapter 21 is admittedly a secondary ending attached to the original Gospel, written by someone other than the one who wrote the first 20 chapters.)  One might be led to think that Thomas' need to see and touch Jesus would end in his saying something like, "I guess I was wrong; I do believe now that you are risen".  Rather, he says "my Lord and my God".  His conclusion from seeing the resurrected Jesus is that Jesus is Lord and God, not simply risen.  How can Thomas conclude from the resurrection of Jesus to his divinity?  In John's Gospel, Jesus consistently says that he will raise himself from the dead, i.e. he will give himself life, life eternal (other Gospels often suggest that it is God who raises Jesus from the dead).  Only God can give such life.  Throughout the Gospel John has presented instances wherein people move from miracle or saying to belief that Jesus is divine.  It is thoroughly Johannine to do this, to write this way.  John never explains how it can be that Jesus is both human and divine, but that does not stop him from affirming his conviction (based in part on Jesus' powers [including his self-resurection], his wisdom, the testimonies of John the Baptist, Moses and the entire OT) that Jesus is the Word -that Word which was with God and was God - now made flesh.  For John, to see and experience Jesus was to see and experience God.  One might aptly suggest that the beginning of the Gospel, in the first verses which explains that Jesus is the Word-made-flesh and abides as divine Son in the bosom of the Father reaches its final value in this final story and statement regarding the identity of Jesus.  Thus, Thomas, who sadly is known as 'Doubting Thomas', deserves to be seen as the one who finishes the story of Jesus by the most profound act of faith: My Lord, My God. </p>

						<h3>April 20, 2014, Year A</h3>

					<p>Acts of the Apostles 10:34a, 37-43; Psalm 118: 1-2, 16-17, 22-23<br/>
					Colossians 3:1-4; John 20:1-9</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Luke in the Acts of the Apostles gives us a resume of Jesus' public life and death at the hands of the Jews at Jerusalem. God was with Jesus who was carrying out the plan of his Father. Like the suffering servant in the first reading, Jesus is put to death to save the guilty and to give glory to the Father. After his resurrection Jesus appeared to many who were his followers --they ate and drank with him during his earthly life. Some of these he commissioned to preach his word to all peoples, and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to judge the living and the dead. As the obedient son of the Father, Jesus' followers are expected to be obedient to his words which are those of the Father. As innocent victim of mankind's treachery and violence, all power and authority have been given to the Son of Man and Lamb of God who by his ignominious death on a cross saved the whole world. At the end of the age he will come in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. </p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>A Jewish day ran from sundown of one day to sundown of the next day, that is, in our reckoning, from 6:00pm of one day till 6:00pm of the next day.  The Sabbath, then, like every day, started at 6:00pm, and ended at 6:00pm of the following, or first day of the new week (i.e. our Sunday).   Given that the Sabbath began at 6:00p.m. only about 3 hours after Jesus' final breath, there was not enough time to take down the body, get permission from Pilate to have the body, and to prepare it thoroughly for burial before the Sabbath; those who would care for the body did as much as they could before the Sabbath began, then rested on the Sabbath (according to Mosaic Law).  Since the Sabbath was over at 6:00p.m., those interested could have gone to the tomb to finish their pious work, but there was no light by which to finish the burial of Jesus until first light, or about 6:00am of the day after the Sabbath or 12 hours after the end of the Sabbath. And so we find Mary, after Sabbath and when there was some visibility, coming to the tomb.  Who the "we" are who "do not know where they put the body" is not certain.  Given that we are in John's Gospel, we find that only Nicodemus and Joseph are named as treating the body of Jesus.  However, we know from other Gospels, that women had come to the tomb precisely to finish the burial customs for the corpse.  Mary's statement to the disciples, "we do not know.", certainly points to others than Mary.  That being so, John has limited his story to Mary's experience there.  [Magdala, a town on the west coast of the Sea of Galilee, means 'tower', suggesting that the town was marked by a tower.]  John's description of Jesus's tomb is limited: it had a heavy stone in front of its entrance (to ward off animals and tomb robbers), one had to bend over to enter through the entrance, and there was enough room in the tomb to have the cloth, wrapped around the deceased's head, put in a place separate from the other cloths in which the body was wrapped.  How many cloths were needed to wrap Jesus is difficult to say; at least two, costly cloths, were used, apart from the head-cloth.  Mary must have entered the tomb: she says with certitude that 'they have taken the Lord from the tomb'; her statement is an important eye-witness account, though she does not venture a guess as to 'who' took the body away.  It seems that neither Mary nor the two disciples (Peter and presumably John, who many say is the 'disciple Jesus loved') had no idea that the emptiness of the tomb is accounted for by the resurrection of the Lord.  That is, no one explained this emptiness until the crucial moment of the story occurs: they saw only cloths, and then believed that Jesus had risen.  What John means to do here is akin to what he has done elsewhere in his Gospel, wherein signs are crucial to faith.  The sign is given here: even to the head-cloth placed 'by someone' elsewhere, John does not explain the process from non-belief to belief.  Rather, he insists to his readership, itself under persecution for being Christians, that their faith is built on signs, as was that of Peter and the other disciple.  Finally, John cleverly uses the Scripture, which he claims foresees Jesus's resurrection (a further witness), as both a testimony to the right conclusion that Jesus is risen and an explanation as a part of the OT which the disciples never understood or used, until they had signs.  Let us repeat here what John had offered his readers in Chapter 5: there are five signs by which to evaluate Jesus and conclude to his identity.  These five signs are what the Father Himself has said, the works of Jesus, the testimony of John the Baptist, the entire testimony of the Old Testament, and the witness of Moses.  Signs are meant to lead to full faith, and so they are, for John, crucial in understanding that one should put one's faith and trust in Jesus, and thereby enjoy life forever.</p>
					<p>[In conclusion, the respect shown Peter reflects to what degree he was esteemed in the tradition of Christians of the 90's AD; there seems to be no time in the years following the death of Christ that Peter, even when he was criticized, was not highly, indeed singularly respected.]   </p>

						<h2>Passion Sunday</h2>
						<h3>April 13, 2014, Year A</h3>

					Philippians 2:6-11; Matthew 26:14 -27:66</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's first reading is excerpted from the suffering servant songs in the book of the prophet Isaiah. In one week we will again celebrate the passion and death of the true Suffering Servant Jesus Christ. He is the one foretold by the prophets in Israel's history. The suffering and passion described in the song will eventually be experienced and fulfilled by Jesus. The innocent servant of God will take upon himself the sins of the guilty and die in Jerusalem that they and the world may live. The Lord gave him a well trained tongue that he might speak to the weary. He did not rebel but gave his back to those who beat him. He did not shield his face from buffets and spitting. The Lord God is his help and he will not be shamed. </p>
					<p>The Gospel of today's Mass is the entire Passion story of Matthew, which is much too long for our study.  So I will discuss the Gospel reading associated with the Blessing of the Palms, a rite which usually precedes Mass and which many hear; this reading from Matthew is very familiar to us: Jesus approaches Jerusalem on a donkey with people throwing palms before him. </p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>To arrive precisely at Jerusalem, one must descend the entire Mount of Olives into a valley (where lies the Garden of Olives), then climb a second, lower mountain, Mount Sion, till one reaches the top of this second mountain, on which is Jerusalem.  At Bethphage, about two miles from Jerusalem, Jesus asks for a mule and its colt; he will ride the rest of the way down the mountain.  Intentional on the part of Matthew is the abruptness and authority and knowledge Jesus exhibits in getting control of these animals.  To a Jew of this time, Jesus is beginning to act like a prophet one sees in the OT.  He need only refer to himself as 'the Master', and his wish will be granted.  We know only of Martha, Mary and Lazarus on this Mount of Olives, but their presence suggests that Jesus had followers even this close to Jerusalem, and indeed in it (recall his commandeering the Upper Room for his Last Supper).  What is most startling about this Matthean story is Jesus' riding on an animal with its colt toward Jerusalem.  Though he needs only one animal for the ride, he chooses two, precisely to make people recall the OT promise at the heart of this event: it is the arrival of the king, seated on an ass, together with its colt.  In brief, Jesus continues as prophet, now not speaking, but acting, and the two animals are essential to his revelation.  Those who knew the OT text recognized that he was, for the only time in his life, consciously revealing his identity: he is king of Jerusalem.  Along the entire route of the journey there were palms trees; these yielded their branches to be waved in honor of the king, and placed as a pleasant road for his journey.  Everything here is tied to one's understanding of 'King of Jerusalem'.  Put briefly, all that Israel could hope for depends on the goodness, power and wisdom of the King; Jesus provides nothing less than that, as he acts out his conviction that he is King of Israel.  Finally, it is the crowd Jesus has drawn (many of which had been accompanying him from Galilee) that expresses its understanding of Jesus' authority and wisdom: he is a prophet, i.e. God is speaking through him in his royal action.  Jesus did not enter Jerusalem seated on the ass; he rode it for the time it took to convey his revelation to the crowds around him.  Though this action of Jesus was singular, it probably happened with many other pilgrims streaming around him; indeed, the Passover, for which Jesus has come to Jerusalem, was attended by many thousands of Jews, even from other lands.  I add a note here.  The Greek text (and subsequent English translation) says simply, ".and he sat on them."  Many scholars understand "them" to refer to the two animals: Jesus was seated on the ass and its colt.  This is a rather awkward picture.  But look at the text again; it says, "They brought the ass and the colt and laid their cloaks over them, and he sat upon them".  The last word "them" can as easily refer to "their cloaks" as to the animals.  Thus, I would prefer to understand the sentence to say: "They brought the ass and the colt and laid their cloaks over them and he sat upon their cloaks".  Not all scholars agree with this interpretation.</p>
					<p>Through these prophetic actions, Jesus has followed the tradition and indicated that he is King of Jerusalem. He will continue his journey to that city and the following week be put to death there, for that is how Jerusalem dealt with prophets. He had prepared the Jews by telling them that he would 'destroy this temple and in three days rebuild it,' but they did not understand. In a short time he will reveal by rising from the dead that he is King of the heavenly Jerusalem and of the world. </p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>There is no explanation in the New Testament about the origin or day-to-day relationship between Lazarus and his sisters, Martha and Mary, and Jesus; we only know they were very good friends, though even such 'friendship' is rarely described.  It is only said that 'Jesus loved them' and wept for the suffering of Lazarus and his sisters.   The usual home of Lazarus and his sisters is Bethany, which is situated high up on the west side of the mountain just east of Jerusalem (the mountain is called the Mount of Olives, because of the olive trees there.).  It is from this high area that Jesus will soon descend to enter Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, and it is from this mountain that, in Matthew, Jesus gives his disciples the command, "Go forth and teach all people, baptizing."  The Lazarus story is basically a cure/miracle story, and as such could be told in few words.  What John has done is expanded this basic story form to teach vital truths about Jesus, ultimately urging ever greater faith in the Jesus who is the source eternal life.  At this time Israelites believed that the soul in some way 'hovered' over its corpse for three days, then finally departed; hence, we have the notice, a defense against unbelievers in John's time, from Martha that her brother died 'four days ago' and so makes clear that Lazarus did not return to life in any other way than through the word of Jesus.  Also: Jesus' remark that Lazarus's illness would not 'end in death' is understood to mean not in 'eternal death', thereby suggesting a restoration to life.  [Technically, Lazarus's return to life is not 'resurrection', but rather 'restoration'; 'resurrection' suggests only the rising to eternal life, not to human life.]  A final detail: Martha begins with her understanding of Jesus as healer/miracle-worker and she ends with belief that Jesus is the Messiah and divine Son of God; this type of movement is a subtle urging of the reader to comprehend what his faith has taught him, that the works of Jesus are nothing short of testimony to his divinity.    Another theological faith statement is that the illness of Lazarus will serve the glory of God; this refers to the power Jesus will exhibit as he stuns everyone with an unheard-of restoration to life.  The significance of the miracle is enhanced by the words which express dismay that Jesus did not come to save his friend from death: what kind of love and power should be ascribed to this apparent callousness?  Again, it is a crowd that expresses the human inability to understand the deepest meaning of Jesus and his love, which the story is appositely meant to affirm.  A powerful point, typical of John's never-ending determination to show the true meaning of Jesus, is Jesus' reference to himself as 'the resurrection and the Life'; i.e. he is the giver of life and not just an intermediary who carries life from God to another human being way.  Finally, Martha at first thought Jesus was referring to the final resurrection of the dead, when he said her brother would rise; many Jews, led by the Pharisees, believed that there would be a moment when all the dead would rise for judgment, then for eternal life, whether in the Kingdom of God or in hell; Jesus makes sure that his action and what it means about him and for human beings is not to be confused with the traditional expectation among many Jews that mankind would someday rise from the dead - this restoration will happen NOW.</p>  
					<p>[A note about the proper reading of the text.  Verses 5, 6, and 7 read as follows:</p>
					<p>So when he [Jesus] heard that he [Lazarus] was ill, he remained for two days in the place where he was.<br/>
					Then after this he said to his disciples, "Let us go back to Judea [in Judea is Bethany]."</p>
					<p>One might read the above to say that Jesus remained in Galilee when he, who 'supposedly' loved Lazarus, ignored him for two days.  It is better to say that the proper conclusion to Jesus' hearing that Lazarus was ill was Jesus' saying to his disciples "Let us go back to Judea".  With this latter understanding we mean to say two things.  First, the trip from Galilee to Bethany took about five days walking; it was not a simple thing to do.  Second, we know that Jesus was filled with the conviction that he must do the Father's will, which was preaching the kingdom and calling for repentance.  To immediately interrupt this vital work to cure Lazarus (when he knew he would restore him from the dead) made no sense to Jesus; it seemed more prudent to do essential work, then go to Lazarus to restore him.  Perhaps John would have written better: "So when he heard that he was ill, he said to his disciples, 'Let us go back to Judea'".  Such would be the proper reading of the text.</p>

					Ephesians 5:8-14; John 9:1-41, or 9:1, 6-9, 13-17, 34-38</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's readings contain themes of seeing, healing, courage to witness, and to persevere. The first reading emphasizes spiritual seeing and the art of active listening in order to discern. The Gospel contains a healing by an action of Jesus  and washing the one healed carrying overtones of baptism. Samuel is sent to the house of Jesse to select the king from his sons. On seeing the fine sons of Jesse he thought that the Lord's anointed must be before him. God taught him otherwise, "Not as man sees does God see, because man sees the appearance, but God looks into the heart." Samuel must wait the Lord's inner voice telling him of the Lord's choice. All of Jesse's sons were not present; the youngest was tending sheep on the mountain (God's traditional dwelling). Upon David's entry into the house, the Lord said, "There --anoint him, for this is the one." With the oil Samuel anointed David in the presence of his brothers and the Holy Spirit rushed upon David. The Gospel reading contains the healing of a man blind from birth and the action to carry out the miracle. The man follows Jesus' instructions and receives faith to worship Jesus and the courage to witness on his behalf against his enemies.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>There are longer and shorter readings of today's Gospel; since the longer form is 41 verses, I suspect that at most Masses the shorter form will be read, and so it is that about which I will write here.</p>  
					<p>The basic story is one of healing; it is in its simplest form a 'miracle-story': the need is presented to Jesus, who heals and then is praised or criticized for his curing.  Most often what is stressed in a miracle-story is the power of Jesus; little is said about the love behind his choice to cure.  Recall that what we have here is a reduction of the original event to a story form, when so often details we would like to have are not preserved, since they are not considered essential to the story's purpose in telling.  A rarity, seen in this story, is the cure, not by word, but by action.  No doubt the ancient world thought that healing powers belonged to clay (akin to our mud baths); saliva was simply necessary where there was no water easily available.  Some interpreters think that we have here with the use of clay a belief in magic, such as that practiced in healing centers throughout the Mediterranean at this time by 'magicians'.  But since Jesus almost always cures by word alone, it seems better to think that his use of clay is a symbol of the spiritual blindness with which one lives without faith in Christ.     It seems that also necessary was the washing of the eyes in water - here the Pool of Siloam (located in the southwestern edge of Jerusalem).  Given that symbolism is a major characteristic of John's Gospel, one concludes that this washing is a symbol of baptism, by which one is cured from sin and given life through the presence of the Holy Spirit.  This role of the Holy Spirit, as giver of life, is greatly emphasized in John's Gospel, as in the Pauline literature; the Spirit remains the continued divine presence earlier experienced in the person of Jesus Christ.  The miracle story eventually becomes a conflict story: a literary presentation of argumentation about some facet of the miracle.  Here, it is the 'Jews' against the cured man; the story now resembles a trial, informal, but still before authority.  [It should be understood that, in this Gospel, 'Jews' almost always means the opposition of certain Jewish authorities to Jesus, whether in his public life or in the later life of the community of believers; thus, 'Jews' does not mean all Jews.]  The particular argument offered by the Jewish authority of the moment is that the cure worked by Jesus was done on the Sabbath, when one is not allowed to work; healing was considered a work and thus not to be done on the Sabbath.  Jesus then is a sinner to this authority.  Typical of John's Gospel is the appeal to fact: 'all I know is that I was blind and now see; who in our history has ever made the blind to see?'  Given that the return of sight is one of the chief promises of Yahweh throughout the OT for his people, and given that such a benefit will characterize the Messiah (whenever he comes and whoever he is), it is not surprising that the newly cured man confesses Jesus to be Messiah - what else could the fact of this cure mean?  The blind man is a symbol of that testimony in which the Gospel places its trust; he was, as Jewish authority claimed, 'born in sin from birth' [that is, he was blind from birth and this was a result of sin, Jews thought], and so should not be trusted.  But the fact is the fact, the cure is the cure, and faith follows upon it, as the Gospel insists.  That Jesus presents himself as Son of Man is a claim that he will be the Judge of the world, separating sinners from the obedient.  On the basis of the cure, the man believes that Jesus is this Son of Man; unfortunately, the 'Jews' do not; they think they are safe from his final judgment.<p>

						<h2>Third Sunday of Lent </h2>

					<p>Exodus 17:1-7; Psalm 95:1-2, 6-7, 8-9<br/>
					Romans 8:1-2, 5-8; John 4:5-42 or 4;5-15, 19b-26, 39a, 40-42</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt and into the desert to freedom. Their bondage in Egypt must be seen here as representing their spiritual bonds. Water is essential and without it we die. The people of the Exodus were to learn just how little faith they had in the Lord their God. At Meribah they tested God and Moses, saying among themselves, "Is the Lord in our midst or not?" They thought and knew that he should be, but they doubted seriously and complained to Moses. Did he intend for them to die in the desert? He in turn 'cried' to the Lord God for help or these people may stone him. The people need to see the signs of God among them, and all must witness it. God must witness to them that they may witness to Him. Moses gathered the elders and all the people around the rock at Meribah, and with his staff, with which he struck the river, strike the rock. Moses did as the Lord commanded and immediately there flowed out clear water for the people to drink. The flowing water that preserves life saved the Israelites who tested God at Meribah. In the Gospel a tired and loving Jesus still desires to give the living water of life to his people.</p>

					<p>Oh, that today you would hear his voice:<br/>
					"Harden not your hearts as a Meribah, <br/>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>We will comment on the longer (very long) form of this Sunday's Gospel, usually called the story of "The Woman at the Well".  This story occurs as one of the seven signs of John's Gospel, signs which are meant to increase faith in Jesus and so secure eternal life.  A first circumstance offered the reader is that this event occurs in Samara.  Geographically, this means Jesus is somewhere between Galilee, where most all of his public life was spent according to the Synoptics, and Judaea, with its capitol Jerusalem, the place "where all the prophets are put to death".  Also, the story centers on a well, and drawing water.  Finally, besides Jesus, the 'other' character of the story is a woman who has come for water at noon.  These details describe something unusual.  That Jesus is so fully immersed in Samaria is something new to Gospel readers; that he will address a woman when the two of them are alone is not customary at all; that the woman draws water at noon suggests what is made clearer in the later story: because of her marital situation(s) she cannot draw water at the time this is usually done by the women of Sychar.  With the disciples away to get some food, Jesus asks the woman for a drink of water.  The woman lodges an objection which is only answered much later in the story: Jews and Samaritans are mortally enemies, and have been ever since the Samaritans began to exist, for despite Samaritans' claims to be the true children of Jacob, Israel considered them heretics, like pagans.  In theory and in practice Samaritans are to be shunned.  Apparently ignoring the woman's protest, Jesus, in the next few verses speaks about a water he could give her if only she asked it of him.  (It is necessary here to be clear about 'water'; well water was brackish, the left-over from the Mediterranean rains.  Good was the water that was fresh.  Everyone wanted flowing or 'living' water; by necessity people had to settle for well water.)  The water Jesus promises is the Holy Spirit, the giver of life; this the evangelist will make clear only in a later chapter.  The woman tries to grasp the identity of Jesus: is he greater than the forefather who provided this well?  Again, Jesus ignores the Christological question of his identity, promising the wonders of the 'water' he can give to one who believes in him.  This part of the story which talks symbolically of the Spirit ends with the woman not really understanding the words of Jesus, but to the believer is assured that presence of the Spirit ('a spring of water) who brings one to eternal life.  John now changes theme: he will note the distinction between pre-Jesus worshipers and Jesus' followers.  The first group had their own places of worship, a mountain of Samaria and the mountain topped by Jerusalem.  From a Jewish point of view, represented by Jesus, the Samaritans worship what 'they do not know' and Jews worship Yahweh of the Old Testament.  But the day has arrived when Christians will worship God in Spirit and truth.  "Spirit" here refers to the presence of the Spirit, the 'spring of water', who will guide Christian worship, a worship which is true, for it is the believer in Christ who has the truth about God.  Such words from Jesus draw the statement, 'these are words of the Messiah, not simply of a prophet.  For the first time, Jesus testifies here that indeed he is the Messiah.  Again, the scene changes to a new focus.  While the woman still ponders whether Jesus be the Messiah (something John's readers already know and believe), Jesus is pictured as looking over ripe Samaritan fields, ready for a harvest.  He now describes himself as one who wants to do his Father's will; he calls this 'wanting' his real food.  He foresees the harvesting which has culminated, by Gospel time, in the faith of many in himself; indeed, John will insist that very many have come to faith in Jesus, so that the Johannine community can understand not only its own role in preaching Jesus, but the fact that it is the result of the preachings of many early Christians.  You might have guessed that John, while narrating an event of the30's AD, is really looking at the whole story from the point of view of Christians in 90'sAD.  Jesus seems to be talking not only to people of his own time, but to the Johannine community now reading Jesus' story.  Finally, John reports the fact that, once the Samaritan citizens met Jesus, who stayed with them for three days (not said by the Synoptics), they no longer needed to hear the testimony of the woman about Jesus; meeting him directly moved them believe in him.  They call him 'Savior of the world'.  As happens in most stories within Chapters  2-12, John makes sure that the Christological titles used in the 90's AD appear in the Gospel.  While it is doubtful that people of Jesus' time understood fully these titles, by 90AD they did, and so John inserts them in their full sense into a story where people grasp the meaning of Jesus only in a limited sense.  We should note that we hear nothing again about the Samaritan woman, and that we meet up with a Christian mission to Samaria only in Chapters 8 and 9 of Acts.  John is more than willing to slide that later mission into his Gospel time, for the Gospel time was to bear the fruit of this later Samaritan mission.</p>

					2 Timothy 1:8b-10; Matthew 17:1-9</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>It is not unusual for God to give one a great need accompanied by the desire to fulfill his need. Abraham's was just such a case. He and his wife were childless and had a great desire to be parents. God would help and asked Abraham to leave his father's house and the land of his kinsfolk for a land the Lord will show him. Abraham obeyed without question at that time. The Lord would make a great nation of him and bless him among the communities of the earth. The test to challenge  Abraham's faith came when God asked him to sacrifice his only son Isaac, thus eliminating any future natural progeny. Abraham was equal to the task and became a man transformed, our father in faith.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>This Gospel narrates the Transfiguration of Jesus on an unspecified mountain top (a favorite place of revelation for Judaism and other religions).  That Peter was chosen to witness this transfiguration is one more sign of his importance in the Christian communities, especially after they grew once Jesus was gone.  Why James and John are present is not so clear, though John is the beloved disciple (if one accepts that identification.  The importance of John and James is made clear from the Acts of the Apostles; they are leaders of the Jerusalem Christian community, the foundation community, and are most important witnesses in that book of the truths about Jesus.  Thus, they, like Peter, grew in importance from the earliest Christian times.  The two concrete qualities that manifested the transfiguration are a 'face that shone like the sun' and 'clothes white as light'.  The transfiguration itself is not explained.  The Jewish psyche would immediately recognize the appeals to sun and light as characteristics of the Divine.  In a Gospel which has witnessed to the divinity of Jesus as born, it is most significant that now the person of Jesus is once again affirmed to be divine.  Further, the affirmation of Jesus' divinity at birth is intended to be a guide to interpreting the entire life of Jesus to be described in the Gospel.  Similarly, there is purpose in revealing him so dramatically as divine here, and that purpose is to leave with the disciples the memory of the real identity of Jesus as he is very soon is about to undergo his Passion.  One must never forget in the horrific treatment of Jesus that he is God.  It is understood that Moses and Elijah are to be interpreted as the pillars of prophecy, Moses for the Law and Elijah for the Prophets.  It is Luke who makes clear the point that these two august figures are discussing with Jesus his coming Passion; it is in the Law and Prophets that one will find the plan that the Messiah abandon for the moment his power and innocence and wisdom so as to undergo the cross.  It is understandable that the disciples want to stay with Jesus as he is revealed to be their God; also understandable is the note that it is Peter speaks the mind of the disciples - Peter who is very outspoken and who is, and will be, the chief spokesman of the earliest witnesses to Jesus.   Their desire to have Jesus stay represents the desire of the Christian communities of Matthew's experience to have Jesus with them always.  'Tents' is a symbol reference to what the OT knows to be 'the good old times' of simple life in the desert with Yahweh.  All is interrupted by God's words from the symbol of cloud.  These are the same words as heard at Jesus' baptism.  There they spoke of a son who was most pleasing because of his devotion to execute the divine plan; here they are directed to his particular obedience to the will of God that he die.  Added to the saying of God are the words, "Listen to him", which is a call to take seriously Jesus' various predictions of his Passion.  As was true throughout the ancient world, to hear the words of God will strike fear in the heart: one is never sure why God intervenes in human life, and that uncertainty makes the human being fearful.  The cloud, symbol in the OT of the presence and movement of God, leaves.  It falls to Jesus to strongly urge his disciples to say nothing of the experience they have witnessed till after his resurrection.  This is a subtle way of saying that only when all the experiences of Jesus's life were put together and meditated upon, did the disciples truly begin to understand all about Jesus.  Before the resurrection they never understood the deepest reality of Jesus, particularly could they make no sense of the suffering of one who was for many months so powerful, wise and close to God. </p>

					Romans 5:12-19 or 5:12, 17-19; Matthew 4:1-11,</p>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's readings present to us Adam and Eve in the Garden with the Serpent and Jesus in the desert with Satan. In the first reading the man and woman fail mankind; in the Gospel Jesus redeems the human race. The Lord God formed man from clay and blew into his nostrils the breath of life. Man became a living human being; at death we will return God's gift to him.   God planted a garden with trees delightful to look at and good for food. The man and woman could eat of the trees in the garden except from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To partake of its fruit was to disobey God, gain knowledge, and to die. The first and second took place immediately; disobedience alienated them from God and they now knew that they were naked. Their wisdom, shame and fear, knowing good and evil. They were dead to God (spiritual death) and would eventually die a natural death --the effects of sin. How  can man redeem himself? He cannot; the creature is of the earth, he is not divine. Having rejected the gift of God's life, man, of himself,  cannot become what he is not. Only God can save mankind; only God can forgive, but to forgive is not to redeem! Today's Gospel reflection gives us some idea of the work and meaning of redemption by Jesus Christ. </p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Jesus' three temptations in the desert, according to Luke. Exegetes look at this episode from two angles: the meaning of the story in itself, then the meaning of the story in the full Gospel.  We look at the story from these two perspectives.  Jesus goes into the desert (presumably that territory east of the Jordan River where he was baptized).  The best suggestion is that Jesus went there to reflect on the experience he had, the coming of the Spirit upon him and the voice from Heaven, "You are my beloved Son, my beloved."  Jesus, we think, understood this experience to be his calling to be the person described in Isaiah's four songs about "the Servant of God".  This servant, Isaiah says, is to preach repentance at first to Israel, then to the nations; thereafter, he, though innocent, will suffer death so that the guilty, who should die for their sins, may go free, forgiven.  With this background we read the temptations of Satan against the completion of these tasks of God's servant, also called 'My beloved Son'.  (Here, that God calls Jesus "My son, the beloved", stresses Jesus' filial obedience, though, as Luke has already argued in the Annunciation, Jesus will be born of the Spirit and Power from on High, and so will be called divine Son of God.  Obedience, not divinity, is stressed now.  The three responses to Satan's temptations are the teaching of this episode.  They are offered to a Satan who does not wonder who Jesus is, but what might move him to back away from the role of Servant.  First, to Satan's suggestion that Jesus will find food by his power, Jesus says that to attain true life, unending life, one must and will obey the word of God.  No human power/wealth, but only obedience to the will of God will merit eternal life.  To Satan's offer of an entire kingdom if Jesus will adore him, Jesus responds with the OT core statement: Only God (Yahweh) do I adore.  One may esteem people greatly, but only one deserves adoration, the Creator of the creature; no one takes God's place, and the creature, as creature, must adore; such is the nature of being a creature.  Finally, to Satan's suggestion that Jesus test God's love for him by putting himself in mortal danger, Jesus affirms that he will not tempt God, because he has no need to prove God's love for him.  This is a statement of total trust in God's unfailing love, no matter what the circumstances (e.g. crucifixion) may be in Jesus' future.  This Lucan narrative serves the entire Gospel in that it reveals, before Jesus' public life begins, what are the essential principles that guide his every choice: obedience to what God wants, adoration of God alone, absolute confidence in God's love for him always.  Luke means to say, then, that, in a world not accustomed to psychology as ours is, the reader must always carry with him this understanding of the workings of Jesus' mind and will.  Jesus will aver to one or other of these principles in his public life, particularly when he notes that he has been sent to announce the presence of the Kingdom of God and that he has come to call sinners.  Most important is the revelation of his mind in the Garden, when, faced with ugly death, he asks his Father to save him, but that he will drink this bitter cup if this is his Father's will.  And he will obey and worship in absolute trust that God's love is even in this crucifixion.</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's reading deal with the relationship between God and mankind, and how mankind is weak on his responsibilities and his understanding of God. "Zion said, 'The Lord has forsaken me; my Lord has forgotten me.'" Really? Out of consideration this "forgetful" Lord maintains his response within the created world and asks: "Can a woman forget her infant; be without tenderness for the child of her womb?" Think about it, such is her love. Even if she were to forget, "I will never forget you." God will not, cannot forget his child. We belong to him, we are part of him and his person as a human being in Jesus Christ. As we see in today's Gospel, He loves his creation and cares for it.</p>
					<p>In the light of this truth about the source of happiness and the obedience or service to achieve it, Jesus will speak of God as only source of the happiness for which we long. Jesus' preference for Yahweh over Riches comes here not from argument, but from his undeniable wisdom: he urges the disciple to "seek first the kingdom of God and all these things will be given you besides (that kingdom)."</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Life is about more than food and the body about more than clothing. Jesus concluded there is more to life than food. What kind of life and what kind of food had he in mind? He refers them to his creatures --they obey God's commands. Look at the birds; they don't sow or reap, but your heavenly Father feeds them, and you are worth so much more to him. The flowers are dressed as beautifully as Solomon in all his glory, yet, at the end of the day they are burned in the furnace. How much more will he care for you, "You of little faith?"</p>
					<p>Isaiah dealing with the feelings of abandonment by Zion, and Jesus dealing with the lack of trust in his disciples, address the same issue -- lack of faith. By becoming aware of our lack of trust and knowledge of God, we are meant to understand Jesus who is God's Beloved Son and a human man. Jesus, himself, had to grow in awareness of God's love for humanity and his creation. Obviously, as part of the  Father's plan, Jesus knew that God loves his creatures, but he had to see and experience as a human, God's love for humanity. This love of God for man, realized by man, is motivation for man to choose to serve God and not Mammon. The birds must search for their food; man must obey God's commands. The animals obey God instinctively; man obeys freely, and with God's grace willingly. The birds forage for their food in their environment; mankind is given his food through receiving the sacraments of the Church --the environment of God in the world. I will never forget you, but we must seek actively the Food of Life, "You of little faith," that we be clothed in robes of glory.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>In this Gospel reading we are given the final two antitheses of the Sermon on the Mount; these antitheses, each in its own way, differ significantly from the teaching of the authoritative teachers of Jesus' time.  Thus, it is a matter of who understands God's will best, whose wisdom best guides human life.   The first antithesis we hear presents the biblical OT teaching, 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth'; the second, 'you shall love your neighbor.'  For a better explanation of the first 'eye for an eye', I should start with the second 'you shall love'.  The command to love neighbor is never joined in the OT with the command to hate one's enemy; that fuller statement is a human effort to make sure the Israelite has nothing to do with an enemy (especially with one who does not respect the Mosaic Law) and thus to limit one's obligation to love one's enemy.  Thus, it is lawful to hate a Samaritan, who is known to deny much of God's action in Israel's favor; Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan flies in the face of this interpretation of God's will about love of neighbor.  Jesus' teaching about God's will insists on love of both neighbor and enemy.  The explanation for this teaching is God's own love of His enemies: He provides life for them instead of death, for He provides the essentials which keep them alive, which are sun and water.  Being a child of a parent means that one will imitate that parent; one looks to God's actions towards His enemies to learn what, of one wants to be a child of God, must imitate.  To help only one's friends is to do what sinners do, those who have no respect for God; one cannot live only with this kind of love.  The question of importance here is: Who is my neighbor?  Paul asked it of his readers, and the authoritative teachers asked it of Jesus (and of each other).  Is one obliged to love a pagan; if not, then a sinful Jew?  Is it not better to say one's obligation to love extends only to the virtuous, for whom one should be willing to suffer?  Jesus says love extends to all, for the Israelite loves as God loves - which means 'all'.  To love only a portion of God's human creatures is to be imperfect; to be perfect, like God, one loves all.  To be 'perfect', 'complete' is the meaning of shalom; thus, be 'shalom', be perfect and complete, like God.  With this understanding of the final antithesis one interprets the previous antithesis (and indeed all antitheses).  Jesus differs from other teachers in his application of the essential command 'love God and love neighbor'.  Jewish teachers agreed with Jesus about the centrality of this divine command.  The antithesis we look at now offers four examples (resistance, cloak as well as tunic, the 'extra mile', giving to the borrower) to consider.  None of these examples are to be raised to the level of universal principle; they are only examples, though of a deeper and universal principle of morality.  (Thus, the non-resistance movement, though founded in part on the words of this antithesis, is not correct if in all circumstances, non-resistance is 'the moral right thing to do'; e.g. one cannot practice, as the will of Jesus, the law of non-resistance if one, while President of a nation, refuses to resist the attacking enemy - such a resistance denies the law of love neighbor and so cannot be considered to be the teaching of Jesus.  Non-resistance is recommended only to the degree that it fosters love of neighbor.)  Again, should one seek payment of a debt by taking property (i.e. a tunic - the undergarment), the debtor should also offer his outer garment (i.e. a cloak).  This action manifests a justice from the debtor, who owes much to the kindness of the lender.  Again, circumstances will dictate when and how such a kindness to a lender fulfills the only law that really matters: love of neighbor.  Another example of this antithesis is 'going another mile'.  It was the law in Israel that one was obliged to carry a soldier's burden (a Roman soldier was an enemy to these Israelites) one mile, provided he be carrying out a military order and the burden was job-related; no doubt, this law was greatly abused.  An example of this law was the forcing Simon from Cyrene, Africa, to carry Jesus' cross to Calvary.  Hateful as it was to be made to carry the enemy's kit, Jesus urges one to offer to go an extra mile - provided that, as always, one is thereby offering love to an enemy.  Finally, there is the example of one wanting or needing to borrow (not of formal begging).  There are reasons for not lending, of course, but Jesus wants the potential lender to be motivated by love of the borrower, not by self-interest alone.      The antitheses are an excellent, though limited, peek at how the Israelites lived and what they were taught virtue to be.  No one denied the importance of the Mosaic Law, but, by Jesus' time, there were significant differences in its interpretation among teachers - and if the differences were crucial enough, one might die to witness the truth of his teaching.  Indeed, so valuable was the teaching of Jesus that Matthew, fifty years after Jesus' life in Israel, thought that his own readership should hear and read it.</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's readings deal with freedom and responsibility. In the first reading illustrates how God expresses his wisdom through his gifts to humankind. Our freedom to choose and keep God's commands saves us; to live in God is the result of our freely trusting him. We can take in our hands fire or water to possess one or the other. We are offered life and death, good and evil, whichever we choose will be given us. In his infinite wisdom God allows us to choose our eternal end!
					We glimpse the depth of God's wisdom and he sees all our actions; his eyes are on those who fear him, for he trusts they will keep his word. He commands no one to act unjustly; he is only good, and no one has license to sin. We are completely free to love God for he favors us, but we must overcome the flesh and our selfish love of self.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Like last Sunday, we are in the famous Sermon on the Mount (somewhere in Galilee).  The 'Mount' is an important symbol in Jewish history; the greatest example of the mount is that famous Mount Sinai - on it Moses received the Covenant Law which unites God (wisdom shared) and Israel (obedience).  Jesus on the Mount presents the will of God anew, i.e. with the perfect interpretation of that will.  Unfortunately, Jesus had to take issue with contemporary interpretations (particularly those of Pharisees, Scribes and Sadducees); he did not disagree with all that Pharisees/Sadducees/Scribes taught, but his disagreements with them were sufficient to have them want him dead.  They thought he was misleading the people in fundamental ways, and that merited him death.  Thus, Matthew presents first a Jesus who makes clear that he is not out to change the Law or to suppress it; after all, it is the wisdom of God and not to be abused.  Rather, should it seem that Jesus is changing the Law (i.e. giving meaning that authoritative Jewish teachers taught) or abandoning it, one should realize that what Jesus is doing is showing the truest, i.e. most perfect understanding of God's will - and let the teachings of others fall by the way.  Indeed, it is understood that the final judgment will focus on one's keeping the Law or not; in the light of this fact, it is foolish to misunderstand and thus not obey the Law or will of God.   Needless to say, Matthew, writing fifty years after the condemnation of Jesus, means to correct the judgment against him by claiming that he, not other teachers, are the ones who ruined the Law of God for the people.</p>     
					<p>The second half of our Gospel reading considers what have come to be called the 'antitheses'; i.e. they are statements of Jesus which are in one way or another antithetical to contemporary teaching.  Our Gospel reading presents four of these antitheses: the subjects of killing, adultery, divorce and swearing oaths.  First, Jesus does not counter present teaching on killing with a teaching of 'no killing'; rather what he takes issue with is the teaching that abuse of neighbor, as long as it is not killing, will not merit condemnation.  His examples of abuse are ugly and merit the condemnation of the existing magistrates of Israel.  Jesus urges forgiveness of neighbor, not killing, noting that it can happen that it will be too late to avoid punishment.  It should be noted that, once one is jailed, the usual way out is that one earn daily, by work in prison, enough money to pay his way out.  His assets are frozen so his family cannot pay his debt.  Second, adultery, a clear violation of the Law, involves not just physical intercourse with someone freely belonging to another, but one can equal physical acts with desires.  Jesus does not distinguish a temptation to lust from a choice of desire; such distinction is left to others to describe.  There follows a teaching about divorce.  Jesus claims that divorce, as an act of 'un-love of neighbor', is wrong.  If one says that Moses allowed for divorce, Jesus corrects him by nothing why Moses allowed this, and appeals to the unbreakable unity intended in the earliest chapters of Genesis.  Now, it is important to realize that, while Jesus forbade divorce for his contemporaries, both Paul and Matthew allowed for divorce for very limited reasons in their own times.  The principle allowing for this change of Jesus' teaching is that Jesus did not face the problems that societies in Paul's (50AD) and Matthew's (85AD) had to face.  The assumption is that Jesus would have agreed with these two disciples, if he had had to deal with their problems.[When all is said and done, scholars are not sure what Matthew means by his phrase, 'except in the case of porneia'; 'porneia' had many sexually impermissible meanings, all of which, if a partner were guilty of them, would allow the other partner to divorc.  Today, the most popular understanding of 'porneia' is to marry within family relationships, such as brother marrying sister.  These relationships, which forbid marriage, are found in Leviticus 18.]  Finally, with oath-swearing, Jesus finds fault with such a practice essentially because it means that one calls on God for the authority to assure the future.  Jesus would rather one leave God out of one's predictions or statements: just say 'yes' or 'no'. Soon we shall see the principle which underlies these and other antitheses, indeed, the entire teaching of Jesus.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>This Gospel reading is part of a 3-chapter account of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.  Matthew is unique and famous for 5 major addresses of Jesus, which are so placed in the Gospel as to seem to intentionally divide the Gospel into more or less equal parts.  The Sermon on the Mount, the first of these 5 discourses, offers a substantial presentation of Jesus' moral teaching, i.e. his wisdom; his wisdom, the Gospel shows, is the most accurate understanding of the mind of God known to human beings in the moral sphere.  After Jesus' famous beatitudes, the Lord turns to two metaphors by which to describe those who believe in him (which means they accept his moral understanding of God's commands).  These two metaphors are salt and light; by means of them, Jesus means to describe his church.    Salt is a commodity quite precious in Jesus' Israel; human beings know it gives life and taste.  Occasionally, a new-born child was wrapped in a salt laden cloth to preserve its life in its new environment outside the womb.  Without salt, one knows food that can be relatively tasteless.  Thus, Jesus means to indicate that his followers are to give life and taste to the human condition; without such "salt" human existence is subject to something like death and has no taste.  These latter elements characterize the world that refuses Jesus.  It belongs the his followers to change the tasteless, lifeless world that knows him not.  [There were no salt-shakers for ordinary people in Galilee; they had rocks of salt, shavings from which would give zest to their food.  When this rock of salt is left on the shelf for a lengthy period, it can lose its saltiness.  What Galileans would do with these rocks was to place them on paths used for walking.  In the extended rainy season, when these dirt paths would be muddy, rocks of salt offered stepping-stones to keep one from slippery mud.]  If a Christian, Jesus teaches, loses his 'saltiness', he offers the world neither life nor zest; such is the world's dependence on Jesus' wisdom and those who practice this wisdom.  While this metaphor-based teaching is positive, the complete words of Jesus turn toward the negative: he speaks about one 'who loses his saltiness'.  This negative aspect contrasts with the second, more positive metaphor-based teaching, that about 'light'.  This difference between 'negative' and 'positive' suggests to scholars that these two sayings were given at first independent of each other, and that it was either Matthew or his source which bound them together as we find them in the Gospel.  This serves as one example among many which argue that the teachings of Jesus, now in one unified form, were originally given separately and on varied occasions; they were later joined together into one discourse which focuses all these disparate sayings on one major theme.  One cannot say enough about the significance of light for the earliest readers of the Gospel.  Note that the first thing God creates in Genesis is light.  Light stands for life, wisdom, truth, love ("you are the light of my life") and joy, and is the opposite to hateful death, foolishness, falsehood, hatred and discouragement.  The OT says that Israel is to be the light of the world, and Jesus says that he is the light of the world.  Now the followers of Jesus are that light, which is spelled out as their deeds.  Their deeds can overcome moral death, foolishness, deceit and hate.  Thus, with a few lines Jesus reveals the glory of his followers: salt to a world tending ever toward lifelessness and tastelessness (meaninglessness) and light to a world for its life and love and wisdom, to know how to live and whom to love.</p>

						<h2>The Feast of the Presentation  of the Lord</h2>
						<h3>February 02, 2014, Year A</h3>

					<p>Malachi 3:1-4; Psalm 21:7, 8, 9, 10<br/>
					Hebrews 2:14-18; Luke 2:22-40 or 2:22-32</p>
							 
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>The prophet Malachi tells us that the Lord is sending his messenger to prepare the way before him. It recalls the coming of the Lord Jesus to Bethlehem described by the prophet Isaiah, but in Malachi the Lord is coming to the Temple in Jerusalem. Saint John tells us that a man named John (the Baptist) was sent by God to prepare the way of the Lord. When the adult Jesus revealed himself as the One, John told the inquiring crowds that he must decrease and Jesus must increase. With the arrival of Jesus in public ministry, the work of his precursor was finished. In Luke's Gospel, Simeon is the one to predict the sufferings in the future of Jesus and Mary. At the sight of the child Jesus Simeon recognized that the promise of God to him had been fulfilled:</p>
					<p>"Now, Master, you may let your servant go in peace, according to your word, for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you prepared in the sight of all peoples; a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory for your people Israel." The Lord Jesus has come to save the world, people are meant repent of their sins as the prophets had said.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>We are given a long Gospel reading, or a shorter version of it.  I will comment on the longer version which includes the material of the shorter version.  The Gospel presents the story of the Presentation of Jesus, and the Purification of Mary.  Luke treats Mary's purification briefly.  She, like all new mothers, was obliged to be purified, i.e. declared 'clean' by an official (a priest in the Jerusalem Temple).  Her impurity was that in childbirth she had emitted blood and other liquids, all of which, as was the understanding of medicine at the time, could make a person ill or dead.  Such a spilling of inner liquids must keep a person from association with other Israelite groups, especially from the women gathered in the women's section of the Jerusalem Temple for communal worship of Yahweh.   Purification, however, was only one obligation imposed by Mosaic Law; a second was that a new-born male was to be offered to God 40 days after his birth (females 80 days).  This is not circumcision, the symbol of belonging to the Chosen People; this offering means to remind Israel that God had let the Angel of Death kill every first-born Egyptian male (animal as well as human) in order to free Israel from Egypt.  The first-born of Israel were saved from this slaughter by putting the blood of a lamb on their doorposts and lintels, thus signaling to the Angel that the first-born of this household should live by God's mercy.  Jesus, a first-born (called that though Mary had no other children), had to be offered in recognition of this wonderful saving event; animals had to be sacrificed in the Jerusalem Temple area, but humans could not be put to death, so an animal (pigeons or turtledoves for the poor) would be sacrificed in the place of the son.  In a broader view, the first-fruit of a harvest was always offered to God in recognition of the fact that all birth/growth ultimately is owed to God, and, technically, is His.   When going about this ritual, Mary and Joseph encounter Simeon; note what he says is inspired, therefore not to be doubted, as the authority for what he says is nothing other than God.  He identifies Jesus as both the light for the Gentiles (who, for Jews, were always 'in the dark' because they knew neither the true God nor, consequently, true human moral conduct) and the glory of Israel (whose glory then is based on Jesus the Jew, particularly because of his death and resurrection - thus, Jesus is the basis for glorifying Israel). Simeon's opening words suggest to many that he represents the OT order, which now is to pass into the greatest of God's benefits - salvation by God-made-man; Israel had longed for this coming and now can be dismissed in favor of Jesus.  Added to Simeon's interpretation of Jesus is his prophecy that Jesus will be a subject of controversy, suggesting that he will die because of disputes about him; his Mother is to suffer as well because of this death.  That Joseph and Mary were amazed at Simeon's words seems impossible given all that had been revealed to them in the previous stories about their child, but the truth is that no revelation intended to make thoroughly understandable what would happen in future events.  Thus, though Mary knew that Jesus was Son of God did not mean she could easily anticipate all that would happen to Jesus and to herself.  Knowledgeable as she was at any one moment, there were always new, unexpected things to learn - she was known principally, not for her intelligence, but for her trust in whatever would come to her from God.  The appearance of Anna, called a prophetess and a faithful Israelite (both meant to fill Luke's reader with continued faith), speaks well of Jesus; her presence, in the Court of the Women (Men had their own Court for prayer), is seen by many exegetes as Luke's attempt to balance prophecy by a man (Simeon) with that of the woman (Anna).  Luke concludes with a brief summary.  An important note is that the 'wisdom' of Jesus is best understood as 'learned wisdom'; i.e. Jesus the adult was very well-versed in the OT, and learned his wisdom from his childhood.  His wisdom is not 'infused' wisdom, nor from his divinity; it was hard-earned by study.  That he was pleasing to God reflects his piety as a young person and as a teenage and young adult.  That he did what he did reflects the truth that, though divine, he was like us in all things (e.g. study and piety), except sin.  As a final note: Simeon's reference to the Gentiles ("he will be a light to the Gentiles") is the one clear reference to speak about the day when the divine word will be spoken to others than Israel; scholars understand it to be a preparation for Luke's second volume, the Acts of the Apostles, a book dedicated to the preaching not done by Jesus who spoke, as Luke has it, only to the Jews.</p>

					1 Corinthians 1:10-13, 17; Matthew 4:12-23 or 4:12-27</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali described as the District of the Gentiles, also had many Jews living there at that time. Its reputation was one of loose living by people who cared little for God's laws. The seaward road leading to the Mediterranean wound its way through that country west of the Jordan. Was the anguish in flight that of Jews living among Gentiles of lax moral standards? Was the darkness dispelled that of Gentiles feeling lost because they had no God? Their reason for joy: the Light of God now shone on both in that land of recent gloom, for Jesus had made Galilee the center from which to preach his word. The people had reason to be joyful as at harvest time to celebrate the fruit of the land and the goodness of God. We see that goodness in today's Gospel. Jesus takes up the mission of John the Baptist who has been imprisoned.  John's mission is just about completed; he has made straight the way of the Lord, who has arrived and is the fruit of John's work. In Jesus John's mission continues and will continue in the world until Jesus returns to reap his harvest.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Zebulun and Naphtali, 2 of the 12 sons of Jacob, were the founders of tribes that carried their names for centuries.  These tribes were established in what was later (and now is) Galilee.  The tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali do not take up all the territory of Galilee in Jesus' time, but they do include such places associated with Jesus such as Nazareth, Cana and Capernaum; Zebulun's eastern border is the Sea of Galilee.  Through this land of Zebulun and Naphtali caravans of precious cargo passed from Egypt all the way to India and from India to Egypt; much of Zebulun and Naphtali was flat land that favored walking traders and their animals. Centuries before the time of Jesus. God, through Isaiah, promised that a great light would appear in land of these two ancient Israelite Patriarchs, i.e. in what would be called Galilee.  It is Matthew who, as so very often, finds the appropriate words of God in the Jewish Scriptures to fit the 'Jesus situation' and who, believing in Jesus, affirms that this Scripture, when fully understood, applied to Jesus.</p>
					<p>Light is one of those primordial images used to counter the human experience of ignorance, doubt and confusion, losing one's way in life, and death.  Thus, when Matthew moves to present Jesus (fresh from his baptism and 40 days in the desert), it seemed most fitting to prepare the reader to understand Jesus: he is the light meant to bring wisdom and life - nothing short of that.  I cannot stress enough the fact that Matthew did not present Jesus in his marvelous activities without a guide, a divine guide (for such is Scripture to these people) by which to interpret Jesus properly.  He is light, and overcomes death and all the little deaths that occur before the final end to life.  It should be said that 'life' is not the same as 'immortality'; in this world there is, for many, no doubt that a human being will continue immortal, after death; the question is will he enjoy life, which includes his own perfection, peace, joy and happiness.  It is to secure the latter that Jesus appears, trying to help people prepare by repentance for the undoubted final judgment, that will decide, not immortality or not, but life or not.  To this initial presentation of Jesus' appearance in Galilee and a summary of his message and his actions, Matthew 'begins at the beginning' by telling of the call of disciples to follow Jesus.  It was quite common that good, wise teachers in Israel would draw students, but it was quite irregular that students would actually give up their livelihoods and families to wander from place to place with this teacher - and it is practically unheard of that women would be among these wandering disciples and teacher.  Matthew's brief descriptions are, no doubt, missing many of the details that these deliberate calls enjoyed; traditional handing down of these stories causes such loss, for storytellers honed their stories so that only details were kept that would help them achieve the reasons for telling their stories.</p>
					<p>In this case, what Matthew wants to stress is the immediacy of four men to leave all at the word of the Lord.  Perhaps it seems psychologically unlikely that people would leave all to follow someone who has not, at least as the story develops, been introduced to the one calling them.  But, as the Infancy Stories have already made clear, this is not 'some stranger', but the Lord, God with us, Messiah and Savior.  Logically, then, the only proper response to a call to total following from this Person is to follow totally.  Is Matthew's concern here to explain the devotedness of the four followers, known in Christian history, as the trusted witnesses to Jesus and the foundation of the Church?  Yes, but even more is Matthew concerned that his story truly be an exhortation that his audience of 80-85AD, in whatever God asks of them, imitate the total obedience of the disciples, for Jesus is Lord.</p>

					1 Corinthians 1:1-3; John 1:29-34</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's first reading is the second suffering servant passage from the prophet Isaiah. Israel is a personification of the servant. Gradually the suffering servant was thought by scholars to be one particular person.   God shows his glory through this person, so Isaiah tells us. The Lord has spoken who has formed him from the womb since the beginning of the world. By following God's words this servant takes upon himself God's strength. God in his goodness will not keep him as a slave but will make him a light to the nations of the world. His mission will be one of suffering and surrender. Today Jesus is believed to be the suffering servant prophesied by Isaiah. His identification and the carrying out of his mission is described below in today's Gospel and reflection.</p> 
					<h4>Psalm Response</h4>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Our Gospel asks us to consider the baptism of Jesus from the viewpoint of the Evangelist John.  This Gospel passage means, in a minor key, to separate Jesus from John, and, in a major key, to begin the testimonies that run throughout the Fourth Gospel: Jesus is the divine Son of God.  This Gospel is content to offer fewer stories about the life of Jesus, but thinks that what it does offer is sufficient to aid its audience to 'believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and that in believing you may have life'.  There is little morality offered in John's Gospel (the most is the rather general statement of Jesus that 'you should love one another as I have loved you' (which is more demanding than what is in the OT: you should love one another as you want to be loved).  Indeed, so much is Christology emphasized to the exclusion of morality that many think that John's First Letter is a correction of this imbalance. John separates himself from Jesus in what is the traditional Christian understanding of the first century: he is greater, I am less.  The sign of this distinction is the difference in baptisms offered by Jesus and John.  John's baptism is a public sign of repentance and a plea for forgiveness; Jesus' baptism is an immersion into the very Life (Holy Spirit) of God and a purging of all impurities in the soul. John claims that his knowledge of Jesus is through a revelation, and is not based on his own judgment: he did not know who Jesus was when he came to be baptized. It is the revelation from God in two moments, the dwelling of divine Life (the Spirit) in Jesus and the attestation of God Himself: this is my Son. Given the authority of the revelations given to John, John can affirm that he believes that Jesus is the Son of God - which affirmation is what the Evangelist hopes will be the attestation of all who read his Gospel.</p>    
					<p>A peculiarity of the Gospel is its focus on the desire for life.  Its claim is that life, if one really wants it, comes, especially if life eternal, from Jesus.  Thus, Jesus will say such things as: anyone who believes in me will not die, but will live forever.  The major works of Jesus in this Gospel all speak, in one way or another, of Jesus' power to give life; the culmination of this series of life-giving works is the final one, the raising of Lazarus from the dead.  Needless to say, what John the Evangelist shows about the public life of Jesus offers a sure means to interpretation of Jesus' crucifixion.  That is, in the light of his wisdom, power and holiness, it would be impossible to think that the crucified is a fool, impotent, and a criminal; there must be some other explanation for his crucifixion, an explanation that squares most fully with what Jesus' public life offers. In this Gospel, the treatment of John the Baptist ends with our present Gospel; and our present Gospel ends with the profession: Jesus is divine Son of God, who will immerse his followers in the very life of God.  I should add that, while the Evangelist insists on the divinity of Jesus, he does so even though he does not explain the mystery of how it is that Jesus and God, apparently in Galilee two separate beings, are really two Persons in one God.  Yet, he affirms Jesus' divinity on every page. Finally, John presents Jesus as divine, not to convert non-believers, but to strengthen those already baptized and believing.  Indeed, all the New Testament is written for believers.</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Today's first reading is the account of the first suffering servant song from the prophet Isaiah. The Lord God describes the personal characteristics of his servant. Who was this innocent servant who took upon himself the sins of others and befuddled scholars as the word of accurate Isaiah? At first he was taken to be the people of Israel as a whole; then he was thought to be an individual person. Finally many scholars believe him to be a prefiguring of Jesus Christ. He is pleasing to the Lord who called him forth into human existence. He is just for he has the Lord's spirit in him. He is meek and humble. He will be a light to the nations, for he is the Light of Life in the world. By his word he will set people free from their sins; his light will reveal our darkness. As the innocent One destined to die for the sins of others, he will accept baptism as the will of the Father and to be one with all sinners.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Each Gospel has its own way of dealing with Jesus' experience of baptism by John.  The fact that each Gospel does speak of this event shows its great importance for understanding the life of Jesus to follow in the rest of the Gospel.  It is significant that this story be the first event in the public life of Jesus for a reason we will see soon.   The Matthean baptism story is divisible into two parts: the dialogue between Jesus and John and the revelation, in two forms, from heaven.    It is difficult to prove that John would have been reluctant to baptize Jesus, for it is difficult to see, from these chapters leading up to this story, how John would have known that Jesus was so much greater than he.  It seems more reasonable to appeal to two elements which could produce our story.  First, Jewish rules of interpretation allow the Jewish Matthew to present events in their fullest meaning. Second, Christian faith, for many years before Matthew wrote (c. 85AD), worked out the correct relationship between John and Jesus, a relationship which was not so clear when John, the same age as Jesus  , was preaching repentance like Jesus.  However, we do know from Luke's account that on Mary's greeting of Elizabeth, the child in her womb leapt for joy. Faith and the mystical meaning of that exchange may be reason for John's statement that Jesus should baptize him. It is allowed then that faith and the 'rules' of the time express the truth of an event, though the data given are not actual; such is the effect of faith over the limitations of facts.</p>  
					<p>This Gospel suggests the problem about why Jesus would seek baptism; after all, faith has shown for years that Jesus was 'like us in all things but sin'.  The solution to this problem lies in the purpose of baptism; it is a public act, using water (the symbol in Israel of cleanliness and life), to manifest the baptized's intention of doing the will of God.  Such was the purpose of Jesus in coming to John - not that Jesus needed to repent, but he wished to manifest in a public way his intention to obey his Father.  It can also be said that Jesus, by being baptized by John, encourages others to have faith in John and do the same.</p>
					<p>The revelational aspect of Matthew's story is expressed by an act and a statement. The Holy Spirit, believed in for decades before the Gospel, showed itself in its coming to dwell in Jesus; this means that he will be guided by the Spirit for his future.  The word of God is meant to identify Jesus (in OT terms) as Messiah, the one anointed (=deputed) by God who finds Jesus to be a faithful child.  Note that we describe Jesus in his human nature, and experience; the Infancy Stories in Matthew have already pointed out his divine nature, that he is God.  It is now up to Jesus to work out what it means to be God's 'beloved son'; that will be understood after spending time in meditation in the desert for forty days.  The effect of all this is the public life of Jesus, empowered by the Spirit to cure and the preaching - and to obey in all circumstances.  After Jesus' baptism (and forty days in the desert) his role now is to announce the presence of God's longed-for kingdom and to call for the repentance that will allow one to enter that blessed kingdom.</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>The birth of the babe at Bethlehem confirms with amazing accuracy the words and the faith of the prophet Isaiah, "Rise up in splendor, Jerusalem! Your light has come, the glory of the Lord shines upon you." His images are fitting for the royal Redeemer. Darkness covers the earth and thick clouds the minds and hearts of the people, but the Lord's glory shines on Jerusalem. "Lift up your eyes and look about you, they all come to you to be enlightened. The first visitors to the new-born King of the Jews, were humble shepherds keeping watch through the night. By contrast his second set of visitors where the learned men from the East. Unlike the political authorities of Jerusalem, threatened by the arrival of their new-born King, they worshipped him and bestowed on him kingly gifts.  The King of the world is welcomed by Gentiles to this humble house on earth. Are the Magi the already enlightened sons who come from afar and read the signs in the skies?

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>[Epiphany means revelation, making clear what was hidden.]  Matthew continues to prepare his reader for the adult life of Jesus by telling a story which reaches people who are not of Israel.  These people, represented by the Magi (= wise men, not kings), have revealed to them a phenomenon about which the heavens speak.  The Wise Men (throughout the centuries the number of Matthew's Wise Men reached seven) are those who dedicated their lives to uncovering the secrets about life and happiness which lie hidden in the heavens, on the earth or under the earth.  Certain wise men report their findings to the king of their country, who then acts on this new wisdom for the betterment of all the members of the kingdom; the happiness of the kingdom often depends on this wisdom.  In our story we meet Herod (the Great) and two of his sons: Archelaus and Antipas.  Herod, through the pleadings of his father in Rome, had his sons named as rulers of Israel to succeed him.  Archelaus ruled the bottom two-thirds of Israel, i.e. the sections of Judaea and Samaria; Antipater ruled the top third, i.e. Galilee.  It is useful to know that Herod the Great was at times maniacal: husband of nine wives, and murderer of many of his children.  It is he whom the Magi visit in Jerusalem, "to find out where the King of the Jews has been born".  It is useful to know that this was precisely the title Rome bestowed on Herod the Great: King of the Jews.  Hence, Herod's desire to kill Jesus.  Jesus was born two years or so before Herod the Great died; it was this Herod who killed the Bethlehem infants in hopes of killing Jesus.  Through God's intervention (no human judgment here), the Family escaped to Egypt where many Jews lived, to return not only after the death of Herod the Great (4BC), but also after Rome, in 6AD, removed Archelaus for his faults and replaced him with a series of Roman procurators.  Thus, the only Herod who ruled in Israel when Jesus was an adult was Herod Antipas; his brother had long given over rule of Judaea and Samaria to procurators, like Pontius Pilate.  What brought the Magi to Israel to look for 'the King of the Jews' was an unheard of movement of heavenly objects, perhaps planets, which Matthew prefers to know as a unique star.  The occurrence of this phenomenon in the heavens spoke to the Magi of something equally wonderful happening in a particular part of the earth, namely Israel.  The star, the Magi learn from their counterparts in Jerusalem, is a reference to the 'star' to arise in Bethlehem, as the prophecy has it.  There, they will find the new King.  The star, which had guided them to Jerusalem, now finishes its journey to lead the Wise Men to the place where Jesus was (a house, not a cave anymore).  Here, they give him extremely precious gifts, fit for a king; they are meant to seal an agreement of peace between the king of the Wise Men and this new king.  By this story Matthew shows that Jesus was meant to be king, not only over Israel, but over all kingdoms, even if currently pagan.  The ultimate point is: the authority behind the kingship of Jesus over all peoples is a divine decision, divinely revealed; there was no human thinking involved here.  God spoke through sign (star) and the Old Testament; there is no room then to doubt this truth about Jesus.</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>On this solemnity today's readings define the quality of relationships between members of God's family. The coming of Jesus into the world gives God a chance to outline the coexistence of believing Christian persons. With Jesus in the Holy Family at Nazareth, God is in the world and the Christian family is in God. The father is in honor over his children; the mother's authority over her sons God confirms. The father and mother have equal authority over the children and are themselves equal partners. Who honors his father atones for sins and is heard when he prays; who reveres his mother stores up riches for himself. Who obeys his father brings comfort to his mother. God will not forget kindness done to one's father. The harmony of Jesus' family is a model for all Christian families which are meant to reflect the loving harmony between the Persons in the Blessed Trinity.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Magi were perpetual students in middle-eastern kingdoms; the best served the king.  Their knowledge was everything knowable, in the heavens, on earth and under the earth.  Their purpose was to provide as much knowledge (wisdom) as possible so that people and kingdoms might know what was necessary to have and maintain happiness, peace and prosperity.  It was understood that, to the person who knew how to read the mysteries of nature, truths were revealed which were unknown by ordinary people.  The Magi of Matthew read the heavens to say that a king was born to the east of their own country (we do not know what country is theirs.).  They knew this because, in their system of knowledge, the star (interpreted as 'king') appeared in a part of the heavens which had its parallel to Israel on earth.  Their king wisely sought peace with this newly born king by sending him extremely precious, rare gifts; the Magi were to be the representatives of the king for this gift-giving meant to affirm peace with the new king of Israel.  Matthew understands this star was meant to recall the prophecy about a 'star' that will arise in Judah to rule (= bring happiness to) Israel.  The Magi sought the exact dwelling of the new king, and, under the guidance of the OT, were told "in Bethlehem", the city of the greatest of the kings, David.  Herod the Great, whom the Magi consulted to find the new king's living quarters, wanted to kill this king: Herod, who died about two years after Jesus' birth, intended to kill the child, but the Magi, who were to tell Herod exactly where to find the child, returned home without seeing Herod again.   Through a series of dreams, which make strong use of the revelations concealed in the OT, Joseph, with his family, escapes to Egypt and remained there until he was told that Herod was dead (c. 4BC); with the aid of a dream, which used the OT, Joseph used his head and brought his family to the divinely predestined Nazareth (= probably 'the City of the Dedicated').  He went to Nazareth prudently, for to return to Bethlehem or Jerusalem would put his family under Herod's successor there, Herod Archelaus, who was a harsh and unbending ruler appointed by Rome, and removed by Rome after about ten years of poor governance.  That Joseph went to Egypt does not mean that he and his family lived in solitude; we know that about this time around one-fourth of Alexandria, the second largest city in the Roman Empire, was Jewish.     It is important to realize that these childhood stories of Jesus, valuable in themselves, really serve as introduction to the story of the adult Jesus.  Jesus was accepted and rejected because of his public life, not because of his birth; indeed, as Mark's Gospel indicates, there is no necessity to recite the childhood of Jesus; what is important is the correct understanding of the adult Jesus.  The childhood stories, therefore, have their value in that they are so thoroughly a revelation from heaven, than which there is no more certain source.  This thought includes God's sacred witness in the OT as well.  Thus, what the reader has as he begins to read about the adult Jesus is a host of ideas about Jesus, all of which have absolute certitude.  This situation is not that of Jesus' contemporaries, who constantly try, and fail, to understand who Jesus is.  Thanks to the childhood stories, the reader knows very well who Jesus is, and reads his story with the fullest understanding of the One in whom he has been baptized. [The Old Testament statement, "Out of Egypt I have called My son", was said about God's freeing (calling) His Israel (loved like a son) through Moses out of the slavery in Egypt; by Jewish rules of interpretation Matthew sees in that the OT statement spoke then in a hidden way, now in full clarity, a truth about Jesus.]</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Fourth Sunday of Advent.  Each Gospel has its own introduction; in Matthew, this introduction consists of his first two chapters, often called the Infancy Narratives.  Why does the Gospel have an introduction?  Consider that the historical figure of Jesus that was of interest to the people of Israel was the adult Jesus of Nazareth; it was this Jesus who preached, worked miracles and taught wisdom.  It was this public and adult Jesus whom people tried to interpret.  And it was this known figure that ultimately was judged and crucified.  In short, the adult, public Jesus is what each Gospel interprets for the benefit of its audience. [The audiences are as different from one another as is each Gospel different from one another.]  For better or for worse, the audiences of Jesus grasped only some of the meaning of Jesus; it is a given among many interpreters that Jesus' close followers really came to understand him at all fully only because of their lengthy reflection on the total life of Jesus which includes the resurrection; indeed, it is only the resurrection that is the final element to assure a proper assessment of the figure that passed through Galilee and Judaea in the 30's AD.  Given the lack of understanding shown throughout Jesus' public life, those who told the story of Jesus many years after his departure felt that their readers should be given a guideline, i.e. a proper understanding of Jesus, before his public life begins.  With this proper understanding, one knows exactly how to read the public life of Jesus, while the many figures he reads about do not know Jesus.     Matthew, like the Luke and John, used the kind of introduction that writers used in both the OT and in their Mediterranean world: the young years, if understood properly, hold the truth about the adult who will soon be described.  Thus, Matthew has chosen to enlighten his reader with stories of Jesus' youngest years and expects the reader to carry with him throughout the public life of Jesus what was told him in the Infancy Stories.  The question then is this: what does Matthew want his reader to know from Jesus' infancy so as to interpret the public and adult Jesus as perfectly, as truthfully, as possible?  First, this child is to be called 'God with us'; though this is not said by divine revelation, it is, in Christian understanding of the OT, a clear and direct claim that Jesus is Son of God, the clearest claim that one will find in all Matthew's Gospel.  Second,, the overwhelming flood of references to the OT is a strong argument that Jesus is the glorious flowering of the seed spread throughout the entire OT.  'The OT, through which God speaks, is completed by and in Jesus'; through God's word, revelation of a different sort from the angel, Matthew presents a certainty to the Jewish Christian audience of Matthew.  One cannot challenge the authority behind the statement that Jesus as the natural fulfillment of the OT.  Third, names are revelatory, especially if given by Heaven; thus, 'Jesus', which means 'God saves through the person bearing this name', is a definitive truth about the person very soon to take center-stage in the Gospel.  Two details:  First, according to Jewish law in Galilee of this time, Joseph and Mary, though not yet married, were legally bound to each other when they accepted an 'engagement'; thus, to leave Mary was a legal action, a public action - and  made Joseph anxious about how to 'put away Mary' without humiliating her.  What saved him was the revelation that Jesus had been conceived by superhuman means, which adds its own astounding truth about the meaning of Jesus.  Second, the central citation from Isaiah is, in transliterated Hebrew: imm - anu - el.  That is, imm means 'with', anu means 'us' and el means 'God'. </p>  
					<p>No one in the remaining part of the Gospel ever came close to knowing what the reader, thanks to Matthew's Infancy Stories, knows so fully and profoundly about Jesus.  The reader is thus advised by the author to bring with him, at every juncture of the Gospel, the revelation with which Matthew has armed him.  Only with what is contained in the Infancy Stories will one truly understand who Jesus is.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Today's Gospel returns us to the earthly side of God's garden. The world dominated garden is not spiritually cultivated; fear and doubt need to be replaced by faith and love. Jesus will use such times to teach the crowds about John the Baptist and the meaning of his mission. Matthew has already explained that John the Baptist is imprisoned; we know John was publicly critical of the ruling Herod Antipas, that son of Herod the Great, who, during Jesus' life ruled Galilee on behalf of the Romans.  For his criticism of Herod's illegal marriage to Herodias, John was put in prison, and could only hear of the many deeds Jesus was performing in the Galilean area.  Such was the talk among the people of Israel that John, like them, looked for the proper interpretation of this Jesus.  Matthew here calls him 'Messiah'; many call him 'prophet'; John wonders, and asks Jesus through John's disciples, "Are you the One who is to come?"  This title represents a phrasing of the Old Testament, which expected God's love for Israel to move God away from punishment of Israel for her sins to a renewal of His relationship described in the term 'Covenant', and summed up in the divine words to Moses, "I will be your God, and you will be My People".  Israel longed for someone to come from God to re-establish this relationship of total love and giving between these two covenant partners.  Isaiah is filled with prophecies assuring people of the certain return of all things to their original state, which is perfection.  This restoration is visible in the many cures of the sick, for thereby what was so imperfect has taken at least one step towards fulfilled perfection.  But who will represent God in this re-making of God's creation?  Jesus answers John's question, not with "I am this One who is to come", but with an invitation to look to his works: are not these the works of the perfecting God, and so of the One who is to come?  John's Gospel (ch 5) offers Jesus' works as one of five witnesses to his divine sonship; these works promise the re-making of the entire world.  Jesus concludes his answer to John by urging John to believe in Jesus; such is the meaning of the generality that blessed is the one who 'takes no offense' at me (i.e. blessed is John if he believes in me). </p>      
					<p>The scene changes; Jesus begins to walk, and now addresses the crowds.  John was highly regarded by many in Israel, having his own followers.  The judgment about him was that he was a prophet in Israel's midst, one of the long line of revered figures.  Jesus improves that opinion.  His argument pushes one to see that John is nothing of this world, that John is truly a voice used by God.  But, he is not simply 'another voice'; he is the final voice which prepares for the coming of Jesus.  As understood in the OT, this OT citation refers to the coming of God at the time of restoration of everyone and everything to perfection; Jesus makes clear that the citation is talking about Himself, the one who a moment earlier described himself to John as doing the works of God.  There is uniqueness about John, because there is a uniqueness of the coming for which he prepares.  That the time turns out not the final perfection of the world means little.  John will now introduce a world in which faith in Jesus will count more than all the blessings Israel had received, more than all the privileges Israel had enjoyed from God's unique love for Israel.  It is faith in Jesus that now will bring one to the kingdom.  John has been chosen to introduce the Divine, but each Israelite will be given the opportunity to choose to believe, and, in believing, will be greater than even John who, though the greatest of the prophets, is not yet a believer.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Given that John was a contemporary of Jesus, and that they preached the same essential message that Israel was to repent so as to enter God's Kingdom, there was understandably a problem: which of the two is the greater?  John had his followers, about whom we hear in 50AD, some 17 years after John's death.  Is such a personage the greatest of those who represented God?  The Christian Church said 'no', and John says 'no' -then who is he?  He is understood to be the greatest prophet (one through whom God speaks) in Israelite history; he prepares people for reunion with God after sin and prepares for the coming of the 'One who is to come', often called 'Messiah' (i.e. 'Christ' or 'King') of Israel.  And of singular significance is the fact that every Gospel feels it must start the story of God's new intervention (to make a new covenant) with Israel with the story of John.  It is with John that God begins His historic and long-awaited offer of peace, of reconciliation with sinful Israel.  A Gospel should not exist without John. the four Gospels testify.  John preached repentance; the repentant entered the waters of the Jordan river a sign and a prayer: a sign that indicated a change of moral life, and a prayer that God would wash away (and so water) sins and give new life, the life of the Covenant union (water also symbolized life).  The dress of John and his food are stark: they symbolize that he is not concerned with this life, but with offering reunion with God.  Clearly, John was very influential, as so many people, including Jesus, went to him to hear his word and be baptized.  Among those who came to him were the religiously and politically powerful, Sadducees and Pharisees; the former were also of the wealthy class.  True, these people, so utterly devoted to the Law, intended, as did John, that Israel repent.  However, as the Gospels witness, these leaders failed in important aspects of obedience to God, particularly respect for the neighbor and a love of wealth and position, of pride.  John demands of them obedience to the Law, and adds a further criticism: you trust that being children of Abraham, they ipso facto are 'just', i.e. will pass the final judgment.  John, echoing Paul and the early Church, insisted that circumcision is no sign of salvation, if it is not accompanied with obedience to the Law.  John was particularly aware that the final judgment was not far off; hence, the urgency for repentance now.  Israelites are reminded of what it means to say that the ax is ready to clear the ground of useless, i.e. fruitless, trees.  The winnowing fan is another sign of the separation of good from bad; that this fan is already in the hands of the "One who is to come" repeats the belief that Judgment is near.  Finally, John recognizes the presence of the "One who is to come", another description of the Messiah; such is the relationship of John to this Person that John knows he is not worthy to be even a servant (tying and untying sandals was the task of the servant for his master).  Above all, John's baptism cannot give what the baptism by the One who is to come will give.  Baptism in Greek means a dipping, here a dipping in the Jordan River or a dipping into the very holy life (Holy Spirit) of God.  He will also 'dip' the believer, the repentant, into fire, that element which destroys (evil) and purifies.  Thus, with Baptism one enters purified into the life of God; one has the Spirit of the believer.</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>The vision of the prophet Isaiah in today's reading invites us to enter into the house of the Lord. Easily recognizable it is built on the highest mountain. The nations of the world are invited to learn the ways of God that they may keep to his words. The Lord God will judge between the nations and shall impose terms on many peoples. Each group will have its particular characteristics to form one unity in God. The instruction will be on peace for the effects of this learning are such that people will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Men will not train for war and one nation will not attack another.  The invitation to climb the mountain of the Lord and so enter his house prepares us for the coming of the Lord and the accompanying events in today's Gospel. The Lord will come at a time we don't expect, the manner of his first coming took us unaware, but having entered his house and kept his word, we are prepared to be surprised.</p>

					<h4>Gospel</h4>
					<p>Jesus' entire public career was spent in 'calling the sinner to repentance'.   This willingness to repent was, in accord with the OT teachings, the means to enter the kingdom of God.  Jesus himself, called to seek repentance from sinners, announced that he had come to proclaim the kingdom of God, into which the repentant may enter.   Today's Gospel, speaking to the era of judgement, concentrates on the unexpectedness of the final judgement; no one knows the day or the hour when it will occur, not even Jesus, according to Matthew 24,36.  One must be prepared for the judgement, i.e. be in the condition of one who is repentant.</p>
					<p>To make clear the readiness one should have in order to have the Judge pass favorable judgement, Jesus uses three examples.  First, there is the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, when those two cities perished for their sins with the people in no way aware of the judgement they should face.  Swift was the punishment, upon those who were least ready for judgement.  Second, Jesus pictures two men in a field, two women grinding at the mill.  The suddenness of God's judgement will remove in a single swoop one of the two men and one of the two women.  The image Jesus wants here is that the Judge, i.e. the Son of Man, will leave behind (for punishment) those who would fail the final judgement, and accepts into the kingdom those who are at every moment ready for judgement.  Third, the daily awareness of possible theft always keeps one ready and alert for the thief; this is above all the case when owner of a house knows when the thief is coming: who would not be prepared?!?  In various ways Jesus argues the wisdom of readiness for judgement.  The judgement will come swiftly, at a moment not foreseen.  If one fails to realize this fact, he will end up with a judgement he could have avoided, if he had readied himself for the 'anytime coming' of the Son of Man.  If only he be ready, alert, he can be one of those 'taken' by the Son of Man, and not one of those 'left behind'.  One is wise only if he is prepared for the Lord; to know that he could come at any time, and yet not be ready for him, is foolishness.</p>
					<p>This Gospel is taken from a late chapter of Luke's Gospel, and is only a section of a much longer discourse of Jesus about the 'end time', a subject very much on the mind of Israelites of Jesus' time; indeed, most prophets over the centuries were preoccupied by the fact that some day God must right all wrongs, and when He does, evil in all its forms will be swept away for those who are pleasing to Yahweh.  The Church puts this teaching of Jesus as a first consideration, as one prepares for the coming of the Lord on Christmas Day.  One knows the day and the hour now, and so, the Church urges everyone to be prepared for God's entry into our world.</p>

					<p><b>To be ready we must choose to be ready, and we must choose to keep the commandments of Jesus. That's the meaning of true freedom!.</b></p>
