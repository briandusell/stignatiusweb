				<h2>Mary in The Redemption</h2>

					<p style="text-align:center">This Retreat was held at <br/>
					<b>Marytown Retreat Center</b><br/>
					1600 West Park Avenue<br/>
					Libertyville, IL 60048<br/>
					Weekend, April 19-21, 2013</p>

					<p>Fr.McAteer offered reflections taken from a book of the same name by Adrienne von Speyr. He reflected God's plan as related to von Speyr in her mystical experiences.<p>
					<p>They all revolve around the same mysterious center, identifiable in the words "pre-redemption" and "co-redemption" The author does not allow superficial misgivings about these terms to impede her, she knows full well the infinite difference between the work of the God-Man and that of his Mother, "who let things be done." (From the Introduction by von Balthasar.)</p>

					<p>Texts referring to these terms are mentioned in the Sacred Scriptures, e.g. the Prologue to John's Gospel describes the Beginning, In the beginning was the word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<p>

					<p>The pregnant Mary with God inside her is the reality that God wants for you and me. I in God and God in me.<p> 

					<p>Saint Paul describes it this way, "I live now not I but Christ lives in me. If God is this interested in Mary's redemption through her role in life, then God is interested in me personally and my return to him. He planned this for me! Mary is chosen; I am chosen. Jesus is our friend who loves us to death. Therefore, we can talk to him as one friend to another and express our most personal and intimate sentiments. Nine eager retreatants, eight women and one man, arrived at Marytown to learn about "Mary in the Redemption." They were not disappointed, according to themselves. They discussed, reflected upon, and prayed over, individually and in group, some of the texts below.</p>

					<h4>Some Terms With Which to be Familiar</h4>

					<p>They may seem difficult but are quite harmless.<br/>
					Pre-existence, Pre-creation, Uncreated, Pre-Redemption, Co-Redemption. Co-Redemptrix</p>

					<p>(Spoken while in ecstasy by von Speyr) The Son wants to redeem the world for the Father. This redemption is obtained through his suffering, in which he bears all sins as his own and the Father recognizes all sinners in him.The moment will therefore come when the Father sees in the Son the sum of all the disgrace he has endured. This is an event of love devised by the Son out of love for the Father and for the world. In this regard, Mary is from the beginning a gift made by the Father and the Holy Spirit to the Son, almost as if the Mother in her instrumentality, signified a form of pre-gift or deposit. </p>

					<p>Mary's Pre-Redemption from the Beginning of Creation (Mary as the First Eve) Mary, the pre-redeemed is already active as the one planned by God. In this respect, she forms a unique encounter between creation and (pre)-redemption. In Mary resides the idea of the perfect human being, an idea that God had when he created the first human being. Thus Mary is in fact not the second Eve but the first Eve; she is the one who did not fall and who saw how the second Eve did fall.</p>

					<h2>Trauma in the Christian Scriptures</h2>

					<div class="image" style="width:133px"><img src="/pmcasj/images/MaryAndAngels.JPG" alt="alternate text" width="133" height="210">
					<p><i>Mary and the Angels</i></p>
					</div>
					<p>The birth of Jesus Christ in a stable, his passion and death on a cross highlight two traumatic moments in his earthly life. Even before his birth the Son of God was rejected by those he came to save. He was born in a cave, a makeshift stable, with an ox and an ass for company, so Mary his mother, "She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the living-space (Luke 2:6). </p>

					<p>Mary laid him in a manger for the world to see; he would be laid on a cross thirty-some years later for the whole world to see and history to ponder. It would be safe to say that this experience for the baby Jesus was traumatic. He who resided in the Holy Trinity amid the choirs of angels comes physically into the world to a stable, on a cold winter's night, to the smell of cattle, with their breath for heat and straw for a bed. It was a 'shock to his system,' but he was with mankind and this is the way it was then. He would have taken it in stride the way that innocence does. He may not have thought of them as traumatic, but conditions were rough and very cold. His was a whole new way of existing and feeling that was strange and dangerous. Even as a child, the man who redeems sinful man will suffer at the hands of sinful men. From living in sinless glory to existing on sinful earth had to be traumatic. 'The Light came into the world and mankind preferred darkness. He was in the world that had come into being through him, and the world did not recognize him' (John 1:9-10). Jesus emptied himself of his Godhead: "Who, being in the form of God, did not count equality with God something to be grasped." (Philippians 2:6-9).</p>

					<p>Apart from the trauma of entering this sinful world, the experience of feelings felt and not understood can be traumatic. Was the Child Jesus traumatized? How could he not be? I believe that he was. As you and I did, he became accustomed to this big bad world, but he understood it so much better. His loving parents, religious upbringing, and reflection on his life and experience would gradually inform him of who he really is. The finding in the temple scene in Luke's Gospel reminds us that Jesus discovered who he is through becoming who he is as a man. We are meant to discover who we are by following the path of Jesus</p>

					<p>A change of worlds, physical, psychological, or spiritual, can lead to great confusion because of the many different feelings never before experienced. Even for older persons, feeling of joy, anger, sadness, love, being loved can also be overwhelming because they have never been felt before. Once understood they can find it very exciting and invigorating. The Second Person of the Blessed Trinity would not have had these feelings, but the Incarnate Jesus did experience feelings. 'Jesus called his disciples to him and said, `I feel sorry for all these people; they have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them off hungry, or they might collapse on the way'" (Matthew 15:32). </p>

					<p>"You wanted no sacrifice or cereal offering, but you gave me a body: "then I said, "Here I am, I am coming to do your will, God"; (Hebrews 10:4-7).</p>

					<p>There is no doubting the trauma and suffering in the horrendous passion and death of Jesus Christ. Despite being the Son of God, and knowing it, and knowing that he is returning to the Father, he did not want to die. He wanted to continue living in his human body. He wasn't afraid of death but like all human beings he wants to live. He dreaded his death on the cross and said so. `Abba, Father!' he said, For you everything is possible. Take this cup away from me. But let it be as you, not I, would have it' (Mark 14:36). Though completely innocent, he would die as a common criminal, convicted by those he came to save. Hating death he would die to save us from eternal death and so serve the Father and us by his sacrificial love. The God-Man born of a woman will die at the hands of the violent men he loves to death. They would jeer and sneer at him until he died. The chief priests and the scribes mocked him among themselves and with others in public, 'He saved others, he cannot save himself' (Mark 15:31)..</p>

					<p>The soldiers mocked him too, coming up to him, offering him vinegar, and saying, `If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself' (Luke 23:36-37). He died with the only one on earth who truly loved him until the end. Mary his mother, and ours, was there to receive his final request and to hear his submission to our heavenly Father. </p>

					<p>"Seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing near her, Jesus said to his mother, `Woman, this is your son.' Then to the disciple he said, `This is your mother.' And from that hour the disciple took her into his home' (John 19:26-27). 'After Jesus had taken the (sour) wine he said, `It is fulfilled'; and bowing his head he gave up his spirit' (John 19:30).</p>

					<p>These two main events in the traumatic life of Jesus contribute greatly to his saving action for all of humanity and brought him home to his heavenly Father. For the believing Christian the road to God's house, in order to live with the Father, is made up of traumatic and ordinary events. We are meant to accept them and live them as God's way of bringing us home. </p>

					<h2>Life's Trauma as Personal Salvation</h2>

					<h3 style="text-align:center">By<br/>
					Patrick J. McAteer, S.J.<br/>
					Thursday, May 07, 2009</h3>

					<div class="image" style="width:166px"><img src="/pmcasj/images/MaryOnCloud.JPG" alt="alternate text" width="166" height="259">
					<p><i>Blessed Virgin Mary</i></p>
					</div>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>The Easter mysteries of Christ's death and resurrection gave me pause to reflect on the passing of time and space, and of interiority and eternity. Today's psycho/spiritual world has revealed similarities in the descriptions of God's and mankind's existence. God's Trinitarian indwelling will always remain the perfect mystery. The same does not hold true for creature man who is mysterious but imperfect, and subject to serious personal wounding. Overwhelmed by accounts of war, violence, starvation, abortion, natural and social disasters, and too often victims and participants in such events, members of society despair of any future recovery.</p>

					<p>In our traumatized world with "Many Voices" crying out for healing from interior wounds, dare we suggest that our Trinitarian God is a "Multiple God?" Is the heavenly world of God, angels, and saints, a world of multiples and alters? Are the three persons in the Trinity three alters of the Godhead. Many Christian churches call such states "Indwelling." The secular world of Human Psychology calls such "splitting" of the person "Multiple Personality Disorder," MPD or DID "Dissociative Identity Disorder." The goal of many therapists, their clients approving, is to reintegrate the person. Jesus founded a community of apostles and disciples on earth which became known as his Church. After his death and resurrection he returned to his followers alive and in a glorified condition. He called them to be spiritually integrated with him and all to become one in union with the Father. Jesus seeks unity with his apostles as an ordered return to God, "May they all be one, just as, Father, you are in me and I am in you, so that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe it was you who sent me" (John 17:21). Jesus an alter of God suffered great trauma through his human condition. He took up his earthly cross by accepting the Father's plan to enter life as the Word made Flesh. To experience human life in the world was the way to most completely reintegrate men with God. A similar cross of pain, risking trauma and abuse, awaits the human person born into life.</p>

					<h4>New Testament</h4>

					<p>St. John's Gospel describes God's pre-creational existence and defines the role of the Word. "In the beginning was the Word: the Word was with God and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things came into being, not one thing came into being except through him. What has come into being in him was life, life that was the light of men" (John 1:1-4).</p>

					<p>When Jesus came to earth, he confirmed the Trinity of Persons and identified them as, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Until then God's existence is as divine persons who are pure spirits. Only Jesus the God-Man experiences life through a sensual human body! Does this make Jesus an Alter God? Alter is defined as something which has changed slightly but remains essentially the same. For Jesus this "change" is another manifestation of the Divine Word. God does not die or shatter because of evil; He "splits" willingly from his own loving goodness and is another manifestation of his uncreated Self. His creation is another, similar, but lesser, manifestation of himself. He chooses to join his creatures through Mary, Mother of all the Living, and God&#8217;s willed maternal alter. Through her the family of alters come together for divine integration. Desolate or consoled, broken or whole, integrated or not, we are still images of God. There is no fracture in him; he cannot be traumatized, but the Man-God can feel pain and its accompanying trauma to death. In terms of alters, all baptized Christians become <I>Alteri Christi</I>, other Christs, and are meant to live out their lives becoming more and more like Christ. Actually, they are meant to live in Jesus as he lives in the Trinity. </p>

					<h4>Jesus' Trauma</h4>
					<p>From living in sinless glory to existing on sinful earth had to be traumatic for Jesus. "The Light came into the world and mankind preferred 
					darkness. He was in the world that had come into being through him, and the world did not recognize him" (John 1:9-10) </p>

					<p>Animal sacrifices did not please God: "You wanted no sacrifice or cereal offering, but you gave me a body: "then I said, `Here I am, I am coming to do your will, God&#8217;" (Hebrews 10:4-7). The earthly suffering of Jesus gives the&nbsp;painful traumas of life&nbsp;meaning. "And going on a little further he fell on his face and prayed. `My Father,' he said, if it is possible, let this cup pass me by. Nevertheless, let it be as you, not I, would have it'" (Matthew 26:39 ).</p>

					<p>Is God a sadistic Father demanding his "pound of flesh" from sinful man through his Son? No. The man who redeems sinful man will suffer at the hands of sinful men. Jesus came to save; the Father allows it as man will have it. Jesus emptied himself of his Godhead: "Who, being in the form of God, did not count equality with God something to be grasped" (Philippians 2:6-9).</p>

					<p>Man's inhumanity to man is our own doing even when the man who suffers is God. Life's abuse has a meaning meant to be discovered. Jesus became man to consciously experience this life and to return all humanity to the Father. As <I>Alter Chtristi</I> we are to become conscious of who we are as we return to God. "Come to me, all you who labor and are overburdened, and I will give you rest. Shoulder my yoke and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. Yes, my yoke is easy and my burden light" (Matthew 11:28-30). This yoke is the cross of human life. Jesus was nailed to it by life's trials and traumas at the hands of sinful man. Carried in Jesus the cross is light, and with him we discover who we are.</p>

					<h4>Pre-creational Existence</h4>

					<p>We are God's children whether we follow Jesus as <i>Alteri Christi</i> or as atheists. We have our own pre-creational existence. God does not change, so we must be in his plan from the beginning: </p>

					<p>"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you came to birth I consecrated you; I appointed you as prophet to the nations" (Jeremiah 1:5). God knows each of us individually and we are consecrated to him in our respective roles in life. </p>

					<p>"You created my inmost self, knit me together in my mother's womb. For so many marvels I thank you; a wonder am I, and all your works are wonders. You knew me through and through" (Psalms 139:13). We are all wonders; as creatures we can be injured by life's abuse, but we are meant to recover our integrity as God's person. Jesus cannot recover his natural goodness since he has not lost it; his natural goodness is to be divine. His going back, recovery, if one will, is to return to God and bring all mankind with him. God is not, cannot be, lessened or wounded, but his begotten Son of Man can die, so his abuse and human suffering will end with his bodily death. Jesus consoles his apostles as his departure nears, yet he will be with them till the end. "On that day you will know that I am in my Father and you in me and I in you" (John 14:20).</p>

					<p>Healing, integration, indwelling take place in time and space in his Cosmic creation and prepare us for what lies beyond. We are meant to 
					complete this journey consciously by growing in awareness of our own personal identity. In this scenario multiplicity, alters, trauma, 
					integration, indwelling become One in all and all in One.</p>
